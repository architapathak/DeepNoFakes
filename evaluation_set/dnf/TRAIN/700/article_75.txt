In these final days of the election the gloves have truly come off. Trump has just released a new ad which ties Hillary’s email scandal and the new FBI investigation to Anthony Weiner, the husband of Hillary aide Huma Abedin.

New Trump ad targets ‘pervert’ Anthony Weiner, dubs Clinton ‘unfit to serve’ 

Donald Trump’s campaign has capitalized on the latest developments surrounding Hillary Clinton’s private email server, releasing a new television ad on Thursday that ties the Democratic presidential hopeful directly to disgraced ex-Congressman Anthony Weiner. 

Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, came back to haunt Democrats last week after FBI officials uncovered more than 650,000 new emails on a device of his, some of which may have originated from Clinton’s unsecured server. The discovery led FBI Director James Comey to reopen the agency’s investigation into Clinton’s handling of classified material. 

“Hillary Clinton is under FBI investigation again after her emails were found on pervert Anthony Weiner’s laptop,” says the narrator of the 30-second ad, which the Trump campaign titled “Unfit.”
