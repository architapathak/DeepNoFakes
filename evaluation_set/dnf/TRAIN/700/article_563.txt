According to WikiLeaks emails published Monday, Hillary Clinton’s staff knew that Anthony Weiner was messaging an underage girl as far back as 2011, yet did nothing about it. The protection of young women isn’t high on the list of priorities when you work for the Democratic nominee. 

RedStateWatcher reported that the email detailed lurid claims of private messages to an underage girl being investigated by police – and was met with the response ‘oof’ by Clinton campaign manager John Podesta. 

“Police on Friday afternoon came to the home of a 17-year-old high school junior to ask her about direct online communications she has had with Rep. Anthony Weiner,” the email read. 

“Two officers from the New Castle County Police Department arrived at the girl’s home around 4:30 p.m. and asked to speak with the girl’s mother about the daughter’s contact with Weiner. Another officer appeared at the home a short time later.” 

Weiner is married to Huma Abedin, Hillary’s top aide. 

In June of 2011, an investigation was launched into his online contact with a 17-year-old Delaware high school student. Since then, the disgraced former Congressman hasn’t been able to kick the habit. (Most recently, he was caught sending suggestive photos of himself to a mistress. His son was asleep in the background of one infamous shot.) 

Abedin herself is now at the center of a fresh FBI investigation into the handling of classified material while Clinton was in office.
