It has been a devastating period for the Hillary Clinton campaign. First, the FBI re-opened the investigation into her e-mail scandal and now, Julian Assange has promised that what’s in the next batch of e-mails to be published to Wikileaks will lead to her arrest. 

Since the first week of October, there have been 21 batches released totaling 35,594 e-mails. According to a message on Twitter, there are more than 50,000 remaining. 

In a broadcast for Russia Today, a London reporter said, “Assange will be releasing more material in what he says will provide enough evidence to see Hillary Clinton arrested.” 

These will be the nail in Hillary Clinton’s coffin, she added. 

Assange assured Russia has no involvement in his e-mail hacking like Democrats are claiming. The DNC servers, he said, were “ripe for hacking” and “riddled with holes.”
