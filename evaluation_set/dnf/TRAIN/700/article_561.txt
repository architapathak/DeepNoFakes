An artificial intelligence (AI) system which correctly predicted the last three elections has put Donald Trump ahead of Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. 

The system is called MogIA, and it was founded in 2004 by Sanjiv Rai, the brains behind the Indian start-up Genic.ai. 

20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. are compiled and analyzed to come up with a prediction. 

It was also determined that enthusiasm for Trump is much higher than it was for Barack Obama in 2008. In fact, Trump has overtaken Obama’s popularity that year by a whopping 25%. 

Rai’s MogIA system has only gotten smarter since it was launched, and even correctly predicted the results of this year’s Republican and Democratic primaries.
