A Gallup poll published on Wednesday indicates that 51% of Americans are more confident in Donald Trump’s ability to serve as president following last week’s presidential election. 40%, conversely, are less confident. Partisanship was strongly correlated with the poll’s respondents’ responses: 95% of Trump voters said they were more confident in presidential capacity after the election, with 75% of Clinton voters saying they were now less confident. The same question was put to Americans by Gallup following the 1992 and 2000 presidential elections. Five weeks after the 1992 election, 84% of Bill Clinton voters said they were more confident in his presidential capability as opposed to 23% of George H. Bush voters and 37% of Ross Perot voters. In 2000, 85% of George W. Bush voters were more confident in his ability to be president as opposed to 29% of Al Gore voters.
