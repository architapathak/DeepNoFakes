Actor Steven Seagal has just stood up for America, while the rest of Hollywood remains silent. This week has been rough for our country. First, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton collapsed at the 9/11 memorial. Then, she called millions of hardworking Americans “deplorable.” As if that weren’t enough, NFL players throughout the country have been blatantly disrespecting the American flag. Needless to say, Seagal had enough. “I think the most important job as Secretary of State is ensuring our people don’t get killed,” Seagal tweeted. “If you can’t do [email protected] “Pneumonia or not, she is going to be disastrous for the American people. #NoToHillary,” he continued. Of course, Seagal quickly became the target of liberal fire for his comments, but he refused to break down. He particularly lost it when one Twitter user tried to argued that Hillary was the most capable for the presidency. “Capable? Capable of leaving AMERICANS to die. Capable of disregarding law. Capable of disrespecting rape survivors,” he argued. He then went on to address race relations in the United States, and the true role President Barack Obama has played in the social evolution of this country. “Obama has been abysmal for race relations in USA. #TRUTH We need to start having honest dialog,” he wrote. Seagal concluded by pointing out the irony of the attacks he was receiving from liberals everywhere. “Best thing in the world…Making one statement about freedom and getting attacked by every Demo out there… #HYPOCRITICAL,” he tweeted. “An America without a democrat in the White House, is a SAFER America.”
