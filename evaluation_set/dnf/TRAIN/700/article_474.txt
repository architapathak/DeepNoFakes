The Orwellian system of “news” distribution which passes for journalism in the United States has never been so hyperactive and audacious, its lies breaking all previous records for sheer cynicism and outright dishonesty. In this space we aim to offer samples, for the record, as it were, although just about ALL the reporting on the MSM on any topic of interest to the US-led plutocracy—from Syria to the Ukraine and Russia, China, Iran, etc, and reports touching on the nature of the US political system (which the plutocracy and its minions continue to hail as a “democracy”), history, the economy, etc., are to be regarded as extremely devious and toxic. .. The saddest part is that this enormous machinery of deception—which by design weaves crude and subtle lies in its tapestry— does have a real and dangerous impact on the way people think here and around the world, and certainly affects the minds and temperaments even of many people who still think of themselves as “progressive” and well educated. Given the multitude of instances, there is no way we can provide on this site a blow by blow analysis of these people’s treacherous statements and pseudo facts. The ONLY antidote we can think of is for you to educate your mind to detect falsehoods by reading regularly sites like The Greanville Post. Eventually you will spot the chicanery a mile away and take appropriate defensive measures. And, we hope, fight back.
