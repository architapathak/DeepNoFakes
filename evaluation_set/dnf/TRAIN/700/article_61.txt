WASHINGTON, D.C.  – When Donald and Melania Trump officially move into the White House, there will be no pancit or chicken adobo on the family menu, just potato tot casserole and pumpkin pie. 

The president-elect has informed The Adobo Chronicles that he is firing Filipina White House Executive Chef Cristeta Comerford. She will be replaced by Paula Deen, American celebrity chef and former TV cooking show host. 

Paula Deen made headlines when a video surfaced in which Deen, in a deposition, admits to using the N-word and making racist and anti-semitic jokes. She also allegedly described her interest in hiring black waiters dressed to look like “slaves” at a wedding.Jun 19, 2013. 

Trump himself has been criticized for racist remarks during his presidential campaign.
