SAN FRANCISCO, California – Now it can be told — now that Hillary Clinton is all but assured of the Democratic presidential nomination. 

For months since the former secretary of state launched her presidential bid, her campaign logo has always symbolized America’s quest to move forward, with the arrow in the logo pointing to the right. Left-handed people, of course, dispute that symbolism because for them, moving forward should be pointing to the left. 

But there is another school of thought about Hillary’s logo. Many believe that the arrow pointing right actually symbolizes moving to the (conservative) right as opposed to the (liberal) left. 

The logo was a brilliant concept designed to help the Democrats win over Republican voters in the general elections — voters who will definitely choose a rightist over a leftist candidate. 

The GOP’s presumptive nominee, Donald Trump, is perceived by many as more leftist than rightist, which would give Clinton the edge among conservative voters. 

Who knew the placement or direction of an arrow could spell victory or defeat for an American presidential candidate?
