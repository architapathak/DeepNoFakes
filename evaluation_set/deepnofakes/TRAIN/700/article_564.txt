Anthony Weiner has checked himself into a clinic which provides counseling for those addicted to cybersex, exhibitionism, anonymous sex and porn. 

The treatment program separates men and women during their stay and electronic devices are banned at the facility. 

Weiner’s world came crashing down in September, when the Daily Mail revealed he was sexting with a 15-year-old school girl, saying such lurid things as, “I would bust that tight p***y so hard and so often that you would leak and limp for a week.” 

In another message, the estranged husband of Hillary Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin told the teen that he woke up “hard” after thinking about her. 

Weiner knew the girl was only 15 at the time. 

An investigation involving Child Protective Services was launched and the police seized Weiner’s laptop (which led to the Clinton bombshell). 

It was also discovered that Clinton’s team knew Weiner had carried out another inappropriate relationship with a separate underage girl as far back as 2011, but did nothing about it.
