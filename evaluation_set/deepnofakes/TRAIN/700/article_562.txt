The FBI found something, but no one had any idea it would be THIS BIG! Huma Abedin clearly never knew what Anthony Weiner had been up to on his electronic devices. That, perhaps, is the understatement of 2016. Allegedly, he was sexting countless women, some of them underage. Some of the pictures that he sent to other women were selfies that revealed his family life. The revelations are disturbing and merit investigations of their own. Given the bizarre nature of Anthony Weiner’s digital habits, who would have ever dreamed that the 2016 Presidential Election would be rocked by the far out notion of critical governmental information on a pervert’s device. No wonder Huma was seen crying on Hillary’s airplane. Huma Abedin, reportedly, says that she has no idea how the emails ended up on her estranged husband’s devices. Could Huma, and her boss, Hillary, be setting Anthony Weiner as a scapegoat? It sounds like something they might do. Perhaps more shocking is the massive amount of emails found on Weiner’s laptop. According to The Washington Post, FIVE DIGITS worth of emails are being researched. That indicates a minimum of 10,000 messages that could implicate Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton, and their new best friend, Anthony Weiner. Oddly enough, Abedin was not a regular user of the device in question. Perhaps the messages were moved there as part of a backup process? Maybe Huma did not have her device family sharing settings configured properly. At this time, Officials do not believe that any of the messages are duplicates. The FBI will certainly use programs designed to “dedup” or weed out duplicates. Any email messages that remain will be examined to determine criminality. Is this new investigation enough to bring down the person who many believe is on course to be the first female President of the United States of America? The irony of a female Presidential candidate being investigated because of a pervert male former Congressman is not lost on me.
