The entrance sign at the Al Amin Islamic Center in Boynton Beach was spray-painted with graffiti containing anti-Islamic and anti- Islamic terrorist messages. ABC News The Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office said deputies responded to a report of vandalism this morning, and that it occurred sometime after midnight and was captured on surveillance video. CAIR officials said the video shows a car pulling up to the mosque about 12:40 a.m. Someone got out of the car, approached the entrance sign and wrote “Fuck Islam” and “Fuck ISIS” with spray paint. “Our community continues to suffer from an increase in hate crimes and hate incidents. We still have fresh in our memories the recent hate crime committed at the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce that was attacked by an arsonist,” CAIR-Florida spokesman Wilfredo Amr Ruiz said in a statement. Muslim Brotherhood-linked Islamic group CAIR, has been designated a terrorist group by the United Arab Emirates. “The hate speech and rhetoric that has come along this presidential campaign is fueling these type of crimes that endanger not only the Muslim community but the Florida community in general.”
