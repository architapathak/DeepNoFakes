Even Clinton’s campaign chair John Podesta blasted Hillary’s use of a private email server in violation of numerous laws. 

“Do we actually know who told Hillary she could use a private email? And has that person been drawn and quartered?” He asked campaign staffer Neera Tanden in a 2015 email . “Like whole thing is fucking insane.” 

The comment stemmed from a discussion on Hillary’s failure to pull away from then-candidate Bernie Sanders in the polls. 

In another email, Tanden suggested Clinton’s top aides never disclosed her use of private email because “ they wanted to get away with it .”
