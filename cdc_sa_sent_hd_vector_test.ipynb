continues in some countries to the present day under various names.', 'The modern system of near-universal national conscription for young men dates to the French Revolution in the 1790s, where it became the basis of a very large and powerful military.', 'Most European nations later copied the system in peacetime, so that men at a certain age would serve 1–3 years on active duty, then transfer to the reserve force.', 'In China, the State of Qin instituted universal military service following the registration of every household .', 'This allowed huge armies to be levied, and was instrumental in the creation of the Qin Empire that conquered the whole of China in 221BC.', 'Conscription is controversial, because of conscientious objection to service, or political objection to service for a disliked government, or an unpopular war, and because it violates individual rights.', 'Those conscripted may evade service, sometimes by leaving the country .', 'Some selection systems accommodate these attitudes by providing alternative service outside combat-operations roles or even outside the military, such as Zivildienst in Austria and Switzerland.', 'As of the early 21st century, many states no longer conscript soldiers, relying instead upon professional militaries with volunteers enlisted to meet the demand for troops.', 'The ability to rely on such an arrangement, however, presupposes some degree of predictability with regard to both war-fighting requirements and the scope of hostilities.', 'Many states that have abolished conscription therefore still reserve the power to resume it during wartime or times of crisis .', 'In the United States, conscription, also called \"the draft\", ended in 1973, but males between 18 and 25 are required to register with the Selective Service System to enable a reintroduction of conscription if necessary.', 'Around the reign of Hammurabi (1791-1750 BCE), the Babylonian Empire used a system of conscription called Ilkum.', 'Under the system those eligible were required to serve in the royal army in time of war .', 'During times of peace they were instead required to provide labour for other activities of the state .', 'In return for this service, those subject to it gained the right to hold land .', 'It is possible that this right was not to hold land per se but specific land supplied by the state .', 'Various forms of avoiding military service are recorded.', 'While it was outlawed by the Code of Hammurabi, the hiring of substitutes appears to have been practiced both before and after the creation of the code .', 'Later records show that Ilkum commitments could become regularly traded .', 'In other places, people simply left their towns to avoid their Ilkum service .', 'Another option was to sell Ilkum lands and the commitments along with them.', 'With the exception of a few exempted classes, this was forbidden by the Code of Hammurabi .', 'Universal conscription in China dates back to the State of Qin, which eventually became the Qin Empire of 221BC.', 'Following unification, historical records show that a total of 300,000 conscript soldiers and 500,000 conscript labourers constructed the Great Wall of China .', 'In the following dynasties, universal conscription was abolished and reintroduced on numerous occasions.', \", universal military conscription is theoretically mandatory in the People's Republic of China, and reinforced by law.\", \"However, due to the large population of China and large pool of candidates available for recruitment, the People's Liberation Army has always had sufficient volunteers, so conscription has not been required in practice at all.\", 'Under the feudal conditions for holding land in the medieval period, most peasants and freemen were liable to provide one man of suitable age per family for military duty when required by either the king or the local lord.', 'The levies raised in this way fought as infantry under local superiors.', 'Although the exact laws varied greatly depending on the country and the period, generally these levies were only obliged to fight for one to three months.', \"Most were subsistence farmers, and it was in everyone's interest to send the men home for harvest-time.\", \"In medieval Scandinavia the 'leiðangr' (Old Norse), 'leidang' (Norwegian), 'leding', (Danish), 'ledung' (Swedish), 'lichting' (Dutch), 'expeditio' (Latin) or sometimes 'leþing' (Old English), was a levy of free farmers conscripted into coastal fleets for seasonal excursions and in defence of the realm.\", 'The bulk of the Anglo-Saxon English army, called the fyrd, was composed of part-time English soldiers drawn from the landowning minor nobility.', 'These thegns were the land-holding aristocracy of the time and were required to serve with their own armour and weapons for a certain number of days each year.', 'The historian David Sturdy has cautioned about regarding the fyrd as a precursor to a modern national army composed of all ranks of society, describing it as a \"ridiculous fantasy\":The persistent old belief that peasants and small farmers gathered to form a national army or fyrd is a strange delusion dreamt up by antiquarians in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries to justify universal military conscription .', 'The system of military slaves was widely used in the Middle East, beginning with the Egyptians training Mamluks from the 9th century, to the Turks and Ottoman Empire through the 19th century.', 'In the middle of the 14th century, Ottoman Sultan Murad I developed personal troops to be loyal to him, with a slave army called the Kapıkulu.', 'The new force was built by taking Christian children from newly conquered lands, especially from the far areas of his empire, in a system known as the devşirme (translated \"gathering\" or \"converting\").', 'The captive children were persuaded to convert to Islam.', 'The Sultans had the young boys trained over several years.', \"Those who showed special promise in fighting skills were trained in advanced warrior skills, put into the sultan's personal service, and turned into the Janissaries, the elite branch of the Kapıkulu.\", 'A number of distinguished military commanders of the Ottomans, and most of the imperial administrators and upper-level officials of the Empire, such as Pargalı İbrahim Pasha and Sokollu Mehmet Paşa, were recruited in this way .', \"By 1609 the Sultan's Kapıkulu forces increased to about 100,000 .\", 'In later years, Sultans turned to the Barbary Pirates to supply their Jannissaries corps.', \"Their attacks on ships off the coast of Africa or in the Mediterranean, and subsequent capture of able bodied men for ransom or sale provided some captives for the Sultan's system.\", 'Starting in the 17th century, Christian families living under the Ottoman rule began to submit their sons into the Kapikulu system willingly, as they saw this as a potentially invaluable career opportunity for their children.', 'Eventually the Sultan turned to foreign volunteers from the warrior clans of Circassians in southern Russia to fill his Janissary armies.', 'As a whole the system began to break down, the loyalty of the Jannissaries became increasingly suspect.', 'Mahmud II forcibly disbanded the Janissary corps in 1826 .', 'Similar to the Janissaries in origin and means of development were the Mamluks of Egypt in the Middle Ages.', 'The Mamluks were usually captive non-Muslim Iranian and Turkish children who had been kidnapped or bought as slaves from the Barbary coasts.', 'The Egyptians assimilated and trained the boys and young men to become Islamic soldiers who served the Muslim caliphs and the Ayyubid sultans during the Middle Ages.', 'The first mamluks served the Abbasid caliphs in 9th century Baghdad.', 'Over time they became a powerful military caste.', 'On more than one occasion, they seized power, for example, ruling Egypt from 1250–1517.', 'From 1250 Egypt had been ruled by the Bahri dynasty of Kipchak origin.', 'Slaves from the Caucasus served in the army and formed an elite corp of troops.', 'They eventually revolted in Egypt to form the Burgi dynasty.', \"The Mamluks' excellent fighting abilities, massed Islamic armies, and overwhelming numbers succeeded in overcoming the Christian Crusader fortresses in the Holy Land.\", 'The Mamluks were the most successful defense against the Mongol Ilkhanate of Persia and Iraq from entering Egypt .', 'On the western coast of Africa, Berber Muslims captured non-Muslims to put to work as laborers.', 'They generally converted the younger people to Islam and many became quite assimilated.', 'In Morocco, the Berber looked south rather than north.', 'The Moroccan Sultan Moulay Ismail, called \"the Bloodthirsty\" (1672–1727), employed a corps of 150,000 black slaves, called his Black Guard.', 'He used them to coerce the country into submission .', 'Modern conscription, the massed military enlistment of national citizens, was devised during the French Revolution, to enable the Republic to defend itself from the attacks of European monarchies.', 'Deputy Jean-Baptiste Jourdan gave its name to the 5 September 1798 Act, whose first article stated: \"Any Frenchman is a soldier and owes himself to the defense of the nation.\"', 'It enabled the creation of the Grande Armée, what Napoleon Bonaparte called \"the nation in arms,\" which overwhelmed European professional armies that often numbered only into the low tens of thousands.', 'More than 2.6 million men were inducted into the French military in this way between the years 1800 and 1813 .', 'The defeat of the Prussian Army in particular shocked the Prussian establishment, which had believed it was invincible after the victories of Frederick the Great.', 'The Prussians were used to relying on superior organization and tactical factors such as order of battle to focus superior troops against inferior ones.', 'Given approximately equivalent forces, as was generally the case with professional armies, these factors showed considerable importance.', 'However, they became considerably less important when the Prussian armies faced forces that outnumbered their own in some cases by more than ten to one.', 'Scharnhorst advocated adopting the levée en masse, the military conscription used by France.', 'The Krümpersystem was the beginning of short-term compulsory service in Prussia, as opposed to the long-term conscription previously used .', 'In the Russian Empire, the military service time \"owed\" by serfs was 25 years at the beginning of the 19th century.', 'In 1834 it was decreased to 20 years.', 'The recruits were to be not younger than 17 and not older than 35 .', 'In 1874 Russia introduced universal conscription in the modern pattern, an innovation only made possible by the abolition of serfdom in 1861.', 'New military law decreed that all male Russian subjects, when they reached the age of 20, were eligible to serve in the military for six years .', 'The range of eligible ages for conscripting was expanded to meet national demand during the World Wars.', 'In the United States, the Selective Service System drafted men for World War I initially in an age range from 21 to 30 but expanded its eligibility in 1918 to an age range of 18 to 45 .', 'In the case of a widespread mobilization of forces where service includes homefront defense, ages of conscripts may range much higher, with the oldest conscripts serving in roles requiring lesser mobility.', 'Expanded-age conscription was common during the Second World War: in Britain, it was commonly known as \"call-up\" and extended to age 51.', 'Nazi Germany termed it Volkssturm (\"People\\'s Storm\") and included men as young as 16 and as old as 60 .', 'During the Second World War, both Britain and the Soviet Union conscripted women.', 'The United States was on the verge of drafting women into the Nurse Corps because it anticipated it would need the extra personnel for its planned invasion of Japan.', 'However the Japanese surrendered and the idea was abandoned .', 'Conscription, which was called \"Service Duty\"() in the Netherlands, was first employed in 1810 by French occupying forces.', \"Napoleon's brother Louis Bonaparte, who was King of Holland from 1806 to 1810, had tried to introduce conscription a few years earlier, unsuccessfully.\", 'Every man aged 20 years or older had to enlist.', 'By means of drawing lots it was decided who had to undertake service in the French army.', 'It was possible to arrange a substitute against payment.', 'Later on, conscription was used for all men over the age of 18.', 'Postponement was possible, due to study, for example.', 'Conscientious objectors could perform an alternative civilian service instead of military service.', 'For various reasons, this forced military service was criticized at the end of the twentieth century.', 'Since the Cold War was over, so was the direct threat of a war.', 'Instead, the Dutch army was employed in more and more peacekeeping operations.', 'The complexity and danger of these missions made the use of conscripts controversial.', 'Furthermore the conscription system was thought to be unfair as only men were drafted.', 'In the European part of Netherlands, compulsory attendance has been officially suspended since 1 May 1997.', 'Between 1991 and 1996, the Dutch armed forces phased out their conscript personnel and converted to an all-volunteer force.', 'The last conscript troops were inducted in 1995 and demobilized in 1996.', 'The suspension means that citizens are no longer forced to serve in the armed forces, as long as it is not required for the safety of the country.', 'Since then, the Dutch army is an all-volunteer force.', 'However, to this day every male citizen aged 17 gets a letter in which he is told that he has been registered, but he does not have to present himself for service.', 'The Dutch army allowed its male soldiers to have long hair from the early 1970s to the end of conscription in the mid 1990s.', 'Even though it is generally thought that conscription has been abolished in the Netherlands, this perception is, in fact, incorrect.', 'The compulsory attendance was abolished, not the conscription.', 'The laws and systems which provide for the conscription of armed forces personnel still remain in place.', 'In Curaçao and Aruba, conscription is still in existence.', 'Britain introduced conscription for the first time in 1916 (halfway through World War I) and abolished it in 1920, and reintroduced it again in 1939 on the outbreak of World War II.', 'It remained in force until 1960.', 'In all, 8,000,000 men were drafted, as well as several hundred thousand women .', 'The introduction of conscription in May 1939, before the war began, was largely due to pressure from the French, who emphasized the need for a large British army to oppose the Germans .', 'Starting in early 1942 unmarried women age 19-30 were conscripted.', \"Most were sent to the factories, but they could volunteer for the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) and other women's services.\", 'None were assigned to combat roles unless they volunteered.', 'By 1943 women were liable to some form of directed labour up to age 51.', 'During the Second World War, 1.4 million British men volunteered for service and 3.2 million were conscripted.', 'Volunteers comprised 20% of the Army, 40% of the Royal Navy, and 50% of the Royal Air Force .', 'The abolition of conscription in Britain was announced on 4 April 1957 by recently elected prime minister Harold Macmillan, with the last conscripts being recruited three years later .', 'In America before 1862, combat duty was always voluntary, but white men aged 18 to 45 were usually required to join local militia units.', 'Colonial militia laws—and after 1776 those of the states—required able-bodied white men to enroll in the militia and to undergo a minimum of military training, all without pay.', 'Colonial Pennsylvania (controlled by Quakers) did not have such laws.', 'Members of pacifist religious denominations were exempt.', 'When combat troops were needed some of the militiamen volunteered for short terms of service, for which they were paid.', \"Following this system in its essentials, the Continental Congress in 1778 recommended that the states draft men from their militias for one year's service in the Continental army; this first national conscription was irregularly applied and failed to fill the Continental ranks.\", 'In 1814, President James Madison proposed conscription of 40,000 men for the army, but the War of 1812 ended before Congress took any action.', 'An 1840 proposal for a standing army of 200,000 men included conscription, but it never passed and military service was voluntary before 1862 .', 'Although both North and South resorted to conscription during the Civil War, in neither region did the system work effectively.', 'The Confederate Congress on April 16, 1862, passed an act requiring military service for three years from all males aged eighteen to thirty-five not legally exempt, and it later extended the obligation.', 'The U.S. Congress followed on July 17, 1862, with an act authorizing a militia draft within a state when it could not meet its quota with volunteers.', 'This state-administered system failed in practice and on March 3, 1863, Congress passed the first genuine national conscription law, setting up under the Union army an elaborate machinery for enrolling and drafting men between twenty and forty-five years of age.', 'Quotas were assigned in each state, the deficiencies in volunteers to be met by conscription.', 'But

Kincheloe and Shirley R. Steinberg, Peter McLaren, Henry Giroux, Antonia Darder, Christine Sleeter, Ernest Morrell, Sonia Nieto, Rochelle Brock, Cherry A. McGee Banks, James A. Banks, Nelson Rodriguez, Leila Villaverde and many other scholars of critical pedagogy have offered an emancipatory perspective on multicultural education.', 'This theory concentrates on the need of including notions of race, class, and diversity while teaching.', 'Multiculturalism supports the idea that students and their backgrounds and experiences should be the center of their education and that learning should occur in a familiar context that attends to multiple ways of thinking.', 'If done correctly, students will develop a positive perception of themselves by demonstrating knowledge about the culture, history, and contributions of diverse groups.', 'This way, multiculturalism is a tool for instilling students with pride and confidence in their unique and special backgrounds.', 'Globalization is a social trend which integrates people with different cultural backgrounds.', 'Culture meet, clash, and grapple with each other as if in the contact zone .', 'Under this circumstance, people started to improve the teaching methods, which means the phenomenon of multicultural education is coming along with the development of globalization.', 'The influence of multicultural education for international students shows on both positive and negative sides.', 'Multicultural education provides a relatively fairer learning environment for international students, which can help them easier to get involved in a new community.', 'Additionally, with the help of this education method, international students can receive more opportunities to better access to knowledge.', 'Moreover, when teachers pay attention to cultivate a multicultural atmosphere, it helps international students to gradually obtain global view.', 'However, multicultural education may cause abandonment of original cultural for international students.', 'Teachers sometimes use multiple examples to satisfy diverse students, but there is no standard benchmark for multicultural education and teachers usually add their own values to their education.', 'Consequently, if teachers try to deliberately concentrate on providing multicultural examples, it may confuse international students and it cannot guarantee a fair education environment.', 'Furthermore, international students may feel being left out when teachers want to emphasize on multiculturalism.', 'Overall, multicultural education is a dialectical issue with two sides.', 'Kincheloe and Steinberg in Changing Multiculturalism (1997) described confusion in the use of the terms \"multiculturalism\" and \"multicultural education\".', 'In an effort to clarify the conversation about the topic, they developed a taxonomy of the diverse ways the term was used.', 'The authors warn their readers that they overtly advocate a critical multicultural position and that readers should take this into account as they consider their taxonomy .', \"Kincheloe and Steinberg's taxonomy of multiculturalism and multicultural education can be summarised as follows: .\", 'Assumptions:\\n\\nUnsuccessful minorities from culturally deprived backgrounds—undermined by a lack of family values.', 'Common culture—WASP norms as invisible barometer for quality form the basis of the curriculum.', 'These norms should be transferred to the next generation.', 'Content of curriculum is decided by dominant cultural norms.', 'I.Q. and achievement tests used uncritically to measure student acquisition of content and student cognitive ability.', 'Non-white ethnic groups are studied in conservative multiculturalism as add-ons to the dominant culture, outsiders expected to melt into the Great Pot.', 'The existing social order is just.', 'Whiteness is not included as an ethnicity—it becomes an invisible barometer of normality.', 'Education is a form of ethnicity striping for economic success.', 'Assumptions:\\n\\nMulticultural education should be based on a notion of “sameness”—we are all the same.', 'Racial inequality exists because of a lack of opportunity for minority groups.', 'Abstract individualism is central to Western social organization.', 'In this context it is believed that all humans can succeed if given a chance.', 'In abstract individualism we are free agents responsible for our own success or failure.', 'Such a position, Kincheloe and Steinberg maintain, often fails to account for hidden forms of racism and norms devised around dominant cultural traits.', 'Everyone enters the competitive race of life from the same starting-line.', 'Celebrations of Black or Latino history month are positive ways of honoring ethnic groups.', 'Critics believe that liberal multiculturalism in this context often tokenizes ethnicity with such add-ons.', 'Whiteness still viewed as “non-ethnic” norm.', 'Studies of racism, sexism, class-bias, homophobia, and colonial oppression viewed as “divisive.”', 'Subjugated knowledge might be studied as a quaint manifestation of diversity—not profound alternative insights that provide everyone new and consciousness changing perspectives on the world.', 'Assumptions:\\n\\nThis discourse often has served as the mainstream articulation of multicultural education over the last 20 years.', 'Pluralist multicultural education shares numerous features with liberal multicultural—it focuses more on difference than liberal multiculturalism.', 'Like liberal multiculturalism, often serves as a form of regulation and decontextualisation that fails to problematise whiteness and the Eurocentric norm.', 'Diversity is intrinsically valuable to the dominant culture in a globalizing world with its free market economy.', 'Curriculum involves learning about Others, their knowledge, values, beliefs, and patterns of behavior.', 'Social unfairness does exist and education should address prejudices and stereotypes.', 'Education should build pride in minority groups’ heritage.', 'It often studies members of such groups who have attained success (implies that anyone can make it).', 'Psychological affirmation is the equivalent of socio-political empowerment.', 'Like liberal multiculturalism often ignores issues of social class.', 'Non-whites are gaining upward mobility and empowerment in ways not matched in reality.', 'Race and ethnicity are viewed as private matters that hold little connection to the complex structures of patriarchy, class elitism and economic colonialism, and white supremacy.', 'The coverage of harsh realities of race, class, gender, and sexual oppression does not have to be “upsetting.”', 'Thus, the horrors of such realities often become a form of cultural tourism instead of a rigorous analysis of human suffering.', 'As prejudice dose exist between different cultures, child from multicultural families could play a role to build a bridge within diverse cultures and help to improve this situation.', 'In order to provide a comfortable education environment to multicultural students, colleges should pay more attentions to care about vary cultures.', 'In this multicultural society, people always get into the social groups with same cultures as them.', 'In a pluralistic multicultural educational society laws exist to prohibit discrimination based on race, color, gender, age, and creed.', 'Even though there are laws, the society of the United States still contain behaviors that are derogatory to some ethnic, cultural, and social groups, and preferential to others.', 'Pluralist multicultural education segregates people.', 'It also tends to isolate people in small individual groups that share the same cultural background.', 'More social unfairness is induced by the pluralistic approach to multicultural education.', 'In pluralistic multicultural education, the differences between cultures are usually being focused on instead of the places where the culture is in common.', 'Main flaw in United States is the fact that pluralism usually separate people and isolate people racially, socially, and culturally different.', 'People with similar cultures usually come together and form bigger cultures.', 'For example, China Town, Little Italy, and The Hood are all formed from a blend of cultures.', 'These cultures usually are defined by economic differences, not by ethnic differences.', 'Assumptions:\\n\\nA caveat: racism, class oppression, sexism, and homophobia are all forms of right-wing essentialism and have a far more pervasive impact on society than left-essentialist multiculturalism \\nCultural differences are central to multiculturalism.', 'Races, ethnic groups, genders, and sexual orientations possess a specific set of characteristics that make them what they are.', 'These essential traits are romanticized, even exoticized in a process that positions difference in a distant past of social/cultural authenticity.', 'This removes various groups from history, culture, and power relations and returns them to a primeval past.', 'One’s ethnicity or gender, their politics of identity guarantees that their pronouncements will be “politically correct.”', 'Such a position undermines our attempt to analyze the ambiguous ways that historical forces shape our lives and our education.', 'That the “good guys” are now the “bad guys” and vice-versa.', 'The curricula that come from this assumption simply invert traditional stereotypes and truth claims.', 'Thus, a multicultural education is created that constructs a seamless history that in its moralistic reductionism fails to understand the subtlety of racism and other forms of oppression.', 'Subjugated knowledge is important in this context, but it is often romanticized as a pure manifestation of natural truth.', 'In this way it can be passed along as a new authoritarian canon.', 'Second caveat: Kincheloe and Steinberg in their critique of left-essentialist multiculturalism in no way imply a rejection of the dire need for African American/Latino/indigenous studies or African American/Latino/indigenous based curricula.', 'Because of the erasure of such knowledge in mainstream curriculum, such scholarship and such curriculum development is necessary.', 'Such ethnic knowledges as well as gender, class, and sexual knowledges need to be studied as both separate and integrated phenomena—separate from white, male, middle/upper class, and heterosexual experience and inseparable from them at the same time.', 'Representations of race, class, gender, and sexuality are grounded on larger complex social struggles.', 'A multicultural curriculum is part of a larger effort to transform the social, cultural, and institutional structures that generate these representations and perpetuate oppression.', 'Race, class, gender, sexual differences exist in the context of power and privilege.', 'Unlike liberal, pluralist, and conservative positions, justice in Western societies already exists and only needs to be distributed more equitably.', 'Community is not built simply on consensus but on, as Paulo Freire put it, unity in diversity.', 'In a multiethnic society that respects but does not essentialize differences, great gains can be realized in the cultivation of critical thinking and ethical reasoning.', 'A homogeneous community grounded on consensus may be unable to criticize the injustice and exclusionary practices that undermine it.', 'Reform of cultural pathology often comes from the recognition of difference, from the interaction with individuals who do not suffer from the same injustices.', 'Multicultural education is based on solidarity in difference: grants social groups enough respect to listen to their perspectives and use them to consider existing social values; realizes lives of individuals in different groups are interconnected to the point that everyone is accountable to everyone else.', 'It is essential to make commitment to the legitimation of multiple traditions of knowledge.', 'Students come to see their own points-of-view as one of many socially and historically constructed ways of seeing.', 'Difference in solidarity expands their social imagination, their vision of what could be.', 'Notions of whiteness and the effects of “being white” should be critically examined—multicultural curriculum in this context explores the social construction of whiteness as an ethnicity.', 'In this move the curriculum is dramatically changed, it investigates both self and other.', 'White male experience must be problematised as the norm, the invisible standard by which other cultures are measured.', 'Subjugated knowledge becomes a living body of knowledge open to different interpretations.', 'It is not simply passed along as the new canon, but is viewed in relation to the old canon.', 'Universities in the United States frequently have a Department of Multicultural Affairs, with the aim of creating an environment that promotes diversity and multiculturalism.', 'According to Talbot, diversity is an environment that consists of the tangible presence of individuals all of which represent unique and different attitudes, characteristics, attributes, and beliefs.', 'Multiculturalism is a developmental journey through which an individual enhances knowledge and skills about different cultures so that he/she can feel comfortable in any situation and can communicate effectively with other individuals from any culture .', 'Talbot states, “Multiculturalism is not an inherent characteristic of any individual, no matter his or her race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or gender; rather, it is based on an individual’s ability and openness to learn” .', 'Therefore, Multicultural Affairs is a college or university’s efforts to incorporate these two concepts within their campuses.', 'Hence, the purpose of Multicultural Affairs is to create an inclusive environment that can support, empower, and encourage all students to develop socio and cultural awareness of diverse cultural backgrounds and lifestyles, as well as, to provide safe inclusive environment where such development can occur.', 'In some form or another, diversity and multiculturalism are integrated or embedded in the framework of many, if not all, college campuses.', 'Multicultural Affairs in some campus environments is a division of Student Affairs, but in others it functions under the Admission Department.', 'Also, Multicultural Affairs serves under different names such as, Ethnic Resource Center, Student Support Services, or Diversity Office.', 'Although they are different in name, many share the same goals and purposes.', 'Castellanos and Gloria proposed that in order for campuses to create a meaningful multicultural environment they must follow seven core competencies, including (1) helping and interpersonal skills; (2) assessment and evaluation; (3) teaching and training; (4) ethical and legal experience; (5) theory and translation; (6) administrative and management skills; (7) multicultural awareness, knowledge, and skills .', 'Multicultural Affairs Centers address and implement cultural awareness and diversity differently.', 'The Multicultural Affairs Centers provide a wide range of support programs for students.', 'Each center encourages student participation in campus life, student organizations, academic excellence, and community service by providing advising, advocacy, mentoring, and leadership training to individual students as they pertain to overall student development issues.', 'While Multicultural Affairs centers their efforts on placing a value of diversity and building a sense of community, campuses implement their efforts in many ways.', 'Advocates of democracy in schooling, lead by John Dewey (1859–1952), argued that public education was

to compel an adversary to do something, or to prevent them from doing something, that another state desires.', 'Deterrence theory gained increased prominence as a military strategy during the Cold War with regard to the use of nuclear weapons.', 'And, it took on a unique connotation during this time as an inferior nuclear force, by virtue of its extreme destructive power, could deter a more powerful adversary -- provided that this force could be protected against destruction by a surprise attack.', 'A credible nuclear deterrent, Brodie wrote, must be always at the ready, yet never used .', 'In Thomas Schelling’s (1966) classic work on deterrence, the concept that military strategy can no longer be defined as the science of military victory is presented.', 'Instead, it is argued that military strategy was now equally, if not more, the art of coercion, of intimidation and deterrence .', 'Thomas Schelling goes on to explain the foundations of deterrence theory based on diplomacy.', 'Diplomacy between states is defined as a form of bargaining that seeks outcomes for each state that though not ideal for either party, are better for both than other alternatives.', 'In order for diplomacy to succeed, there must be some common interest, if only in the avoidance of mutual damage.', 'Traditionally in military strategy, mutual pain and suffering are among the results of warfare, however they have also been incidental and not the primary purpose.', \"In the development of military strategy however, Schelling (1966) argues the capacity to hurt another state is now used as a motivating factor for other states to avoid it and influence another state's behaviour.\", 'In order to be coercive or deter another state, violence has to be anticipated and avoidable by accommodation.', 'It can therefore be summarised that the use of the power to hurt as bargaining power is the foundation of deterrence theory, and is most successful when it is held in reserve .', 'More recent scholarship has made the case that deterrence theory is logically inconsistent, not empirically accurate and deficient as a theory.', 'In place of classical deterrence, rational choice scholars have argued for \"perfect deterrence,\" which assumes that states may vary in their internal characteristics and especially in the credibility of their threats of retaliation .', 'In a January 2007 article in the Wall Street Journal, veteran cold-war policy makers Henry Kissinger, Bill Perry, George Shultz and Sam Nunn reversed their previous position and asserted that far from making the world safer, nuclear weapons had become a source of extreme risk .', 'The use of military threats as a means to deter international crises and war has been a central topic of international security research for decades.', 'Research has predominantly focused on the theory of rational deterrence to analyse the conditions under which conventional deterrence is likely to succeed or fail.', 'Alternative theories however have challenged the rational deterrence theory and have focused on organisational theory and cognitive psychology.', 'The concept of deterrence can be defined as the use of threats by one party to convince another party to refrain from initiating some course of action .', 'A threat serves as a deterrent to the extent that it convinces its target not to carry out the intended action because of the costs and losses that target would incur.', 'In international security, a policy of deterrence generally refers to threats of military retaliation directed by the leaders of one state to the leaders of another in an attempt to prevent the other state from resorting to the threat of use of military force in pursuit of its foreign policy goals.', 'As outlined by Huth, a policy of deterrence can fit into two broad categories being (i) preventing an armed attack against a state’s own territory (known as direct deterrence); or (ii) preventing an armed attack against another state (known as extended deterrence).', 'Situations of direct deterrence often occur when there is a territorial dispute between neighboring states in which major powers (e.g. the United States) do not directly intervene.', 'On the other hand, situations of extended deterrence often occur when a great power becomes involved.', 'It is the latter than has generated the majority of interest in academic literature.', 'Building on these two broad categories, Huth goes on to outline that deterrence policies may be implemented in response to a pressing short-term threat (known as immediate deterrence) or as strategy to prevent a military conflict or short term threat from arising (known as general deterrence).', 'A successful deterrence policy must be considered in not only military terms, but also in political terms.', 'In military terms, deterrence success refers to preventing state leaders from issuing military threats and actions that escalate peacetime diplomatic and military cooperation into a crisis or militarized confrontation which threatens armed conflict and possibly war.', 'The prevention of crises of wars however is not the only aim of deterrence.', 'In addition, defending states must be able to resist the political and military demands of a potential attacking nation.', 'If armed conflict is avoided at the price of diplomatic concessions to the maximum demands of the potential attacking nation under the threat of war, then it cannot be claimed that deterrence has succeeded.', 'Furthermore, as Jentleson et al.', \"argue, two key sets of factors for successful deterrence are important being (i) a defending state strategy that firstly balances credible coercion and deft diplomacy consistent with the three criteria of proportionality, reciprocity and coercive credibility, and secondly minimises international and domestic constraints; and (ii) the extent of an attacking state's vulnerability as shaped by its domestic political and economic conditions.\", 'In broad terms, a state wishing to implement a strategy of deterrence is most likely to succeed if the costs of non-compliance it can impose on, and the benefits of compliance it can offer to, another state are greater than the benefits of noncompliance and the costs of compliance.', 'Deterrence theory holds that nuclear weapons are intended to deter other states from attacking with their nuclear weapons, through the promise of retaliation and possibly mutually assured destruction (MAD).', 'Nuclear deterrence can also be applied to an attack by conventional forces; for example, the doctrine of massive retaliation threatened to launch US nuclear weapons in response to Soviet attacks.', 'In order for a nuclear deterrent to be successful, a country must preserve its ability to retaliate either by responding before its own weapons are destroyed or by ensuring a second strike capability.', \"A nuclear deterrent is sometimes composed of a nuclear triad, as in the case of the nuclear weapons owned by the United States, Russia and the People's Republic of China.\", 'Other countries, such as the United Kingdom and France, have only sea-based and air-based nuclear weapons.', 'Proportionality .', 'Jentleson et al.', 'provide further detail in relation to these factors.', \"Firstly, proportionality refers to the relationship between the defending state's scope and nature of the objectives being pursued, and the instruments available for use to pursue this.\", \"The more the defending state demands of another state, the higher that state's costs of compliance and the greater need for the defending state’s strategy to increase the costs of noncompliance and the benefits of compliance.\", 'This is a challenge, as deterrence is, by definition, a strategy of limited means.', 'George (1991)  goes on to explain that deterrence may, but is not required to, go beyond threats to the actual use of military force; but if force is actually used, it must be limited and fall short of full scale use or war otherwise it fails.', 'The main source of disproportionality is an objective that goes beyond policy change to regime change.', 'This has been seen in the cases of Libya, Iraq and North Korea where defending states have sought to change the leadership of a state in addition to policy changes relating primarily to their nuclear weapons programs.', 'Reciprocity .', 'Secondly, Jentleson et al.', \"outline that reciprocity involves an explicit understanding of linkage between the defending state's carrots and the attacking state's concessions.\", 'The balance lies neither in offering too little too late or for too much in return, not offering too much too soon or for too little return.', 'Coercive credibility .', 'Finally, coercive credibility requires that, in addition to calculations about costs and benefits of cooperation, the defending state convincingly conveys to the attacking state that non-cooperation has consequences.', \"Threats, uses of force, and other coercive instruments (such as economic sanctions) must be sufficiently credible in order to raise the attacking state's perceived costs of noncompliance.\", 'A defending state having a superior military capability or economic strength in itself is not enough to ensure credibility.', \"Indeed, all three elements of a balanced deterrence strategy are more likely to be achieved if other major international actors (for example the United Nations or NATO) are supportive and if opposition within the defending state's domestic politics is limited.\", 'The other important consideration outlined by Jentleson et al.', \"that must taken into consideration is the domestic political and economic conditions within the attacking state affecting its vulnerability to deterrence policies, and the attacking state's ability to compensate unfavourable power balances.\", 'The first factor is whether internal political support and regime security are better served by defiance, or if there are domestic political gains to be made from improving relations with the defending state.', 'The second factor is an economic calculation of the costs that military force, sanctions, and other coercive instruments can impose, and the benefits that trade and other economic incentives may carry.', \"This in part is a function of the strength and flexibility of the attacking state's domestic economy and its capacity to absorb or counter the costs being imposed.\", 'The third factor is the role of elites and other key domestic political figures within the attacking state.', \"To the extent these actors' interests are threatened with the defending state's demands, they will act to prevent or block the defending state's demands.\", 'The predominant approach to theorizing about deterrence has entailed the use of rational choice and game-theoretic models of decision making (see game theory).', \"Deterrence theorists have consistently argued that deterrence success is more likely if a defending state's deterrent threat is credible to an attacking state.\", 'Huth outlines that a threat is considered credible if the defending state possesses both the military capabilities to inflict substantial costs on an attacking state in an armed conflict, and if the attacking state believes that the defending state is resolved to use its available military forces.', 'Huth goes on to explain the four key factors for consideration under rational deterrence theory being (i) the military balance; (ii) signaling and bargaining power; (iii) reputations for resolve; and (iv) interests at stake.', 'The military balance .', \"Deterrence is often directed against state leaders who have specific territorial goals that they seek to attain either by seizing disputed territory in a limited military attack or by occupying disputed territory after the decisive defeat of the adversary's armed forces.\", 'In either case, the strategic orientation of potential attacking states is generally short term and driven by concerns about military cost and effectiveness.', 'For successful deterrence, defending states need the military capacity to respond quickly and in strength to a range of contingencies.', \"Where deterrence often fails is when either a defending state or an attacking state under or overestimate the others' ability to undertake a particular course of action.\", 'Signaling and bargaining power .', 'The central problem for a state that seeks to communicate a credible deterrent threat through diplomatic or military actions is that all defending states have an incentive to act as if they are determined to resist an attack, in the hope that the attacking state will back away from military conflict with a seemingly resolved adversary.', 'If all defending states have such incentives, then potential attacking states may discount statements made by defending states along with any movement of military forces as merely bluffs.', \"In this regards, rational deterrence theorists have argued that costly signals are required to communicate the credibility of a defending state's resolve.\", 'Costly signals are those actions and statements that clearly increase the risk of a military conflict and also increase the costs of backing down from a deterrent threat.', 'States that are bluffing will be unwilling to cross a certain threshold of threat and military action for fear of committing themselves to an armed conflict.', 'Reputations for resolve .', 'There are three different arguments that have been developed in relation to the role of reputations in influencing deterrence outcomes.', \"The first argument focuses on a defending state's past behaviour in international disputes and crises, which creates strong beliefs in a potential attacking state about the defending state's expected behaviour in future conflicts.\", \"The credibilities of a defending state's policies are arguably linked over time, and reputations for resolve have a powerful causal impact on an attacking state's decision whether to challenge either general or immediate deterrence.\", 'The second approach argues that reputations have a limited impact on deterrence outcomes because the credibility of deterrence is heavily determined by the specific configuration of military capabilities, interests at stake, and political constraints faced by a defending state in a given situation of attempted deterrence.', \"The argument of this school of thought is that potential attacking states are not likely to draw strong inferences about a defending states resolve from prior conflicts because potential attacking states do not believe that a defending state's past behaviour is a reliable predictor of future behaviour.\", 'The third approach is a middle ground between the first two approaches.', 'It argues that potential attacking states are likely to draw reputational inferences about resolve from the past behaviour of defending states only under certain conditions.', 'The insight is the expectation that decision makers will use only certain types of information when drawing inferences about reputations, and an attacking state updates and revises its beliefs when the unanticipated behaviour of a defending state cannot be explained by case-specific variables.', 'Interests at stake .', 'Although costly signaling and bargaining power are more well established arguments in rational deterrence theory, the interests of defending states are not as well known, and attacking states may look beyond the short term bargaining tactics of a defending state and seek to determine what interests are at stake for the defending state that would justify the risks of a military conflict.', 'The argument here is that defending states that have greater interests at stake in a dispute will be more resolved to use force and be more willing to endure military losses in order to secure those interests.', 'Even less well established arguments are the specific interests that are more salient to state leaders such as military interests versus economic interests.', 'Furthermore, Huth argues that both supporters and critics of rational deterrence theory agree that an unfavourable assessment of the domestic and international status quo by state leaders can undermine or severely test the success of deterrence.', 'In a rational choice approach, if the expected utility of not using force is reduced by a declining status quo position, then deterrence failure is more likely, since the alternative option of using force becomes relatively more attractive.', 'Schelling is prescriptive in outlining the impact of the development of nuclear power in the analysis of military power and deterrence.', 'Nuclear weapons give nations the potential to not only destroy their enemies but humanity itself without drawing immediate reprisal because of the lack of a conceivable defense system and the speed with which nuclear weapons can be deployed.', \"A nation's credible threat of such severe damage empowers their deterrence policies and fuels political coercion and military deadlock, which in turn can produce proxy warfare.\", 'United States policy of deterrence during the Cold War underwent significant variations.', 'The early stages of the Cold War were generally characterized by ideology of containment, an aggressive stance on behalf of the United States especially regarding developing nations under their sphere of influence.', 'This period was characterized by numerous proxy wars throughout most of the globe, particularly Africa, Asia, Central America, and South America.', 'A notable such conflict was the Korean War.', 'In contrast to general opinion, George F. Kennan, who is taken to be the founder of this ideology in the famous Long Telegram, asserted that his ideas had been misinterpreted and that he never advocated military intervention, merely economic support.', 'With the US pullout in Vietnam, the normalization of US relations with China, and the Sino-Soviet Split, the policy of Containment was abandoned and a new policy of détente was established, whereby peaceful coexistence was sought between the United States and the Soviet Union.', 'Although all factors listed above contributed to this shift, the most important factor was probably the rough parity achieved in stockpiling nuclear weapons with the clear capability of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD).', 'Therefore, the period of détente was characterized by a general reduction in the tension between the Soviet Union and the United States and a thawing of the Cold War, lasting from the late 1960s until the start of the 1980s.', 'The doctrine of mutual nuclear deterrence characterized relations between the United States and the Soviet Union during this period, and present relations with Russia.', \"A third shift occurred with President Ronald Reagan's arms build-up during the 1980s.\", 'Reagan attempted to justify this policy in part due to concerns of growing Soviet influence in Latin America and the new republic of Iran, established after the Iranian Revolution of 1979.', 'Similar to the old policy of containment, the United States funded several proxy wars, including support for Saddam Hussein of Iraq during the Iran–Iraq War, support for the mujahideen in Afghanistan, who were fighting for independence from the Soviet Union, and several anti-communist movements in Latin America such as the overthrow of the Sandinista government in Nicaragua.', 'The funding of the Contras in Nicaragua led to the Iran-Contra Affair, while overt support led to a ruling from the International Court of Justice against the United States in Nicaragua v. United States.', 'While the army was dealing with the breakup of the Soviet Union and the spread of nuclear technology to other nations beyond the United States and Russia, the concept of deterrence took on a broader multinational dimension.', 'The US policy on post–Cold War deterrence was outlined in 1995 in a document called \"Essentials of Post–Cold War Deterrence\" .', 'This document explains that while relations with Russia continue to follow the traditional characteristics of Mutual Nuclear Deterrence, due to both nations continuing MAD, US policy of deterrence towards nations with minor nuclear capabilities should ensure through threats of immense retaliation (or even preemptive action) that they do not threaten the United States, its interests, or allies.', 'The document explains that such threats must also be used to ensure that nations without nuclear technology refrain from developing nuclear weapons and that a universal ban precludes any nation from maintaining chemical or biological weapons.', 'The current tensions with Iran and North Korea over their nuclear programs are due in part to the continuation of this policy of deterrence.', 'Deterrence theory is criticized for its assumptions about opponent rationales.', 'First, it is argued that suicidal or psychotic opponents may not be deterred by either forms of deterrence .', 'Second, if two enemy states both possess nuclear weapons, Country \"X\" may try to gain a first strike advantage by suddenly launching weapons at Country \"Y\", with a view to destroying its enemy\\'s nuclear launch silos thereby rendering Country \"Y\" incapable of a response.', 'Third, diplomatic misunderstandings and/or opposing political ideologies may lead to escalating mutual perceptions of threat, and a subsequent arms race which elevates the risk of actual war - a scenario illustrated in the movies WarGames and Dr. Strangelove.', 'An arms race is inefficient in its optimal output, as all countries involved expend resources on armaments that would not have been created if the others had not expended resources.', 'This is a form of positive feedback.', 'Fourth, escalation of perceived threat can make it easier for certain measures to be inflicted on a population by its government, such as restrictions on civil liberties, the creation of a military-industrial complex, and military expenditures resulting in higher taxes and increasing budget deficits.', 'In January 2007 a seminal article appeared in the Wall Street Journal, authored by Henry Kissinger, Bill Perry, George Shultz and Sam Nunn.', 'These men were veterans of the cold-war era with impeccable credentials as believers in using nuclear weapons for deterrence.', 'But they now reversed their previous position and asserted that far from making the world safer, nuclear weapons had become a source of extreme risk: .', 'The risk of accidents, misjudgments or unauthorised launches, they argued, was growing more acute in a world of rivalries between relatively new nuclear states that lacked the security safeguards developed over many years by America and the Soviet Union.', 'The emergence of pariah states, such as North Korea (possibly soon to be joined by Iran), armed with nuclear weapons was adding to the fear as was the declared ambition of terrorists to steal, buy or build a nuclear device.', 'Only by a concerted effort to free the world of nuclear weapons could the terrifying trend be reversed .', 'A new form of criticism emerged in the late 1980s with detailed analyses of the actions of individual leaders and groups of leaders in crisis situations (historical and theoretical).', 'A number of new or nuanced criticisms of \"traditional\" deterrence theory emerged.', 'One was that deterrence theory assumed that both sides had common rational peaceful goals.', 'In some real-life situations, such as the Yom Kippur War, leaders felt that internal or external political considerations forced a conflict.', 'One of the essays in, regarding the internal military and political discussions within the Egyptian high command in 1973, indicates that senior civilian leaders (including Anwar Sadat) believed that they had to fight a war in order to have enough internal political support to negotiate for peace.', 'In another miscalculation, Israel rationalized that the Israeli military dominance would deter any attack, and believed that no rational Syrian or Egyptian leader would attempt such an attack.', \"Sadat felt unable to avoid a war, and Syria's leadership misjudged the military situation and believed they could be victorious.\", 'Israel assumed rational and well-informed opponents with clear objectives, and its deterrence failed.', 'Another observation is that crisis situations can reach a point whereby formerly stabilizing actions such as keeping military units at bases, and low alert levels can be seen as a sign of weakness, which may provoke an enemy to attack during the perceived time of advantage.', 'Thus, an inversion point exists, after which some seemingly stabilizing actions become destabilizing, and some formerly destabilizing actions become stabilizing.', 'Finally, studies of the specific group psychology of several leaders and leader groups, including the Israeli and Arab leaders in 1973 and the Kennedy Administration during the Bay of Pigs Invasion and Cuban Missile Crisis, indicated that in many cases executive groups use poor decision-making techniques and improperly assess available information.', 'These errors can preclude truly rational end-behavior in deterrence situations.']),\n",

       "        list(['Deterrence in foreign affairs, as Bernard Brodie (1959) wrote in his seminal work, is nothing new.', 'In the simplest sense, deterrence means using the threat of military action to compel an adversary to do something, or to prevent them from doing something, that another state desires.', 'Deterrence theory gained increased prominence as a military strategy during the Cold War with regard to the use of nuclear weapons.', 'And, it took on a unique connotation during this time as an inferior nuclear force, by virtue of its extreme destructive power, could deter a more powerful adversary -- provided that this force could be protected against destruction by a surprise attack.', 'A credible nuclear deterrent, Brodie wrote, must be always at the ready, yet never used .', 'In Thomas Schelling’s (1966) classic work on deterrence, the concept that military strategy can no longer be defined as the science of military victory is presented.', 'Instead, it is argued that military strategy was now equally, if not more, the art of coercion, of intimidation and deterrence .', 'Thomas Schelling goes on to explain the foundations of deterrence theory based on diplomacy.', 'Diplomacy between states is defined as a form of bargaining that seeks outcomes for each state that though not ideal for either party, are better for both than other alternatives.', 'In order for diplomacy to succeed, there must be some common interest, if only in the avoidance of mutual damage.', 'Traditionally in military strategy, mutual pain and suffering are among the results of warfare, however they have also been incidental and not the primary purpose.', \"In the development of military strategy however, Schelling (1966) argues the capacity to hurt another state is now used as a motivating factor for other states to avoid it and influence another state's behaviour.\", 'In order to be coercive or deter another state, violence has to be anticipated and avoidable by accommodation.', 'It can therefore be summarised that the use of the power to hurt as bargaining power is the foundation of deterrence theory, and is most successful when it is held in reserve .', 'More recent scholarship has made the case that deterrence theory is logically inconsistent, not empirically accurate and deficient as a theory.', 'In place of classical deterrence, rational choice scholars have argued for \"perfect deterrence,\" which assumes that states may vary in their internal characteristics and especially in the credibility of their threats of retaliation .', 'In a January 2007 article in the Wall Street Journal, veteran cold-war policy makers Henry Kissinger, Bill Perry, George Shultz and Sam Nunn reversed their previous position and asserted that far from making the world safer, nuclear weapons had become a source of extreme risk .', 'The use of military threats as a means to deter international crises and war has been a central topic of international security research for decades.', 'Research has predominantly focused on the theory of rational deterrence to analyse the conditions under which conventional deterrence is likely to succeed or fail.', 'Alternative theories however have challenged the rational deterrence theory and have focused on organisational theory and cognitive psychology.', 'The concept of deterrence can be defined as the use of threats by one party to convince another party to refrain from initiating some course of action .', 'A threat serves as a deterrent to the extent that it convinces its target not to carry out the intended action because of the costs and losses that target would incur.', 'In international security, a policy of deterrence generally refers to threats of military retaliation directed by the leaders of one state to the leaders of another in an attempt to prevent the other state from resorting to the threat of use of military force in pursuit of its foreign policy goals.', 'As outlined by Huth, a policy of deterrence can fit into two broad categories being (i) preventing an armed attack against a state’s own territory (known as direct deterrence); or (ii) preventing an armed attack against another state (known as extended deterrence).', 'Situations of direct deterrence often occur when there is a territorial dispute between neighboring states in which major powers (e.g. the United States) do not directly intervene.', 'On the other hand, situations of extended deterrence often occur when a great power becomes involved.', 'It is the latter than has generated the majority of interest in academic literature.', 'Building on these two broad categories, Huth goes on to outline that deterrence policies may be implemented in response to a pressing short-term threat (known as immediate deterrence) or as strategy to prevent a military conflict or short term threat from arising (known as general deterrence).', 'A successful deterrence policy must be considered in not only military terms, but also in political terms.', 'In military terms, deterrence success refers to preventing state leaders from issuing military threats and actions that escalate peacetime diplomatic and military cooperation into a crisis or militarized confrontation which threatens armed conflict and possibly war.', 'The prevention of crises of wars however is not the only aim of deterrence.', 'In addition, defending states must be able to resist the political and military demands of a potential attacking nation.', 'If armed conflict is avoided at the price of diplomatic concessions to the maximum demands of the potential attacking nation under the threat of war, then it cannot be claimed that deterrence has succeeded.', 'Furthermore, as Jentleson et al.', \"argue, two key sets of factors for successful deterrence are important being (i) a defending state strategy that firstly balances credible coercion and deft diplomacy consistent with the three criteria of proportionality, reciprocity and coercive credibility, and secondly minimises international and domestic constraints; and (ii) the extent of an attacking state's vulnerability as shaped by its domestic political and economic conditions.\", 'In broad terms, a state wishing to implement a strategy of deterrence is most likely to succeed if the costs of non-compliance it can impose on, and the benefits of compliance it can offer to, another state are greater than the benefits of noncompliance and the costs of compliance.', 'Deterrence theory holds that nuclear weapons are intended to deter other states from attacking with their nuclear weapons, through the promise of retaliation and possibly mutually assured destruction (MAD).', 'Nuclear deterrence can also be applied to an attack by conventional forces; for example, the doctrine of massive retaliation threatened to launch US nuclear weapons in response to Soviet attacks.', 'In order for a nuclear deterrent to be successful, a country must preserve its ability to retaliate either by responding before its own weapons are destroyed or by ensuring a second strike capability.', \"A nuclear deterrent is sometimes composed of a nuclear triad, as in the case of the nuclear weapons owned by the United States, Russia and the People's Republic of China.\", 'Other countries, such as the United Kingdom and France, have only sea-based and air-based nuclear weapons.', 'Proportionality .', 'Jentleson et al.', 'provide further detail in relation to these factors.', \"Firstly, proportionality refers to the relationship between the defending state's scope and nature of the objectives being pursued, and the instruments available for use to pursue this.\", \"The more the defending state demands of another state, the higher that state's costs of compliance and the greater need for the defending state’s strategy to increase the costs of noncompliance and the benefits of compliance.\", 'This is a challenge, as deterrence is, by definition, a strategy of limited means.', 'George (1991)  goes on to explain that deterrence may, but is not required to, go beyond threats to the actual use of military force; but if force is actually used, it must be limited and fall short of full scale use or war otherwise it fails.', 'The main source of disproportionality is an objective that goes beyond policy change to regime change.', 'This has been seen in the cases of Libya, Iraq and North Korea where defending states have sought to change the leadership of a state in addition to policy changes relating primarily to their nuclear weapons programs.', 'Reciprocity .', 'Secondly, Jentleson et al.', \"outline that reciprocity involves an explicit understanding of linkage between the defending state's carrots and the attacking state's concessions.\", 'The balance lies neither in offering too little too late or for too much in return, not offering too much too soon or for too little return.', 'Coercive credibility .', 'Finally, coercive credibility requires that, in addition to calculations about costs and benefits of cooperation, the defending state convincingly conveys to the attacking state that non-cooperation has consequences.', \"Threats, uses of force, and other coercive instruments (such as economic sanctions) must be sufficiently credible in order to raise the attacking state's perceived costs of noncompliance.\", 'A defending state having a superior military capability or economic strength in itself is not enough to ensure credibility.', \"Indeed, all three elements of a balanced deterrence strategy are more likely to be achieved if other major international actors (for example the United Nations or NATO) are supportive and if opposition within the defending state's domestic politics is limited.\", 'The other important consideration outlined by Jentleson et al.', \"that must taken into consideration is the domestic political and economic conditions within the attacking state affecting its vulnerability to deterrence policies, and the attacking state's ability to compensate unfavourable power balances.\", 'The first factor is whether internal political support and regime security are better served by defiance, or if there are domestic political gains to be made from improving relations with the defending state.', 'The second factor is an economic calculation of the costs that military force, sanctions, and other coercive instruments can impose, and the benefits that trade and other economic incentives may carry.', \"This in part is a function of the strength and flexibility of the attacking state's domestic economy and its capacity to absorb or counter the costs being imposed.\", 'The third factor is the role of elites and other key domestic political figures within the attacking state.', \"To the extent these actors' interests are threatened with the defending state's demands, they will act to prevent or block the defending state's demands.\", 'The predominant approach to theorizing about deterrence has entailed the use of rational choice and game-theoretic models of decision making (see game theory).', \"Deterrence theorists have consistently argued that deterrence success is more likely if a defending state's deterrent threat is credible to an attacking state.\", 'Huth outlines that a threat is considered credible if the defending state possesses both the military capabilities to inflict substantial costs on an attacking state in an armed conflict, and if the attacking state believes that the defending state is resolved to use its available military forces.', 'Huth goes on to explain the four key factors for consideration under rational deterrence theory being (i) the military balance; (ii) signaling and bargaining power; (iii) reputations for resolve; and (iv) interests at stake.', 'The military balance .', \"Deterrence is often directed against state leaders who have specific territorial goals that they seek to attain either by seizing disputed territory in a limited military attack or by occupying disputed territory after the decisive defeat of the adversary's armed forces.\", 'In either case, the strategic orientation of potential attacking states is generally short term and driven by concerns about military cost and effectiveness.', 'For successful deterrence, defending states need the military capacity to respond quickly and in strength to a range of contingencies.', \"Where deterrence often fails is when either a defending state or an attacking state under or overestimate the others' ability to undertake a particular course of action.\", 'Signaling and bargaining power .', 'The central problem for a state that seeks to communicate a credible deterrent threat through diplomatic or military actions is that all defending states have an incentive to act as if they are determined to resist an attack, in the hope that the attacking state will back away from military conflict with a seemingly resolved adversary.', 'If all defending states have such incentives, then potential attacking states may discount statements made by defending states along with any movement of military forces as merely bluffs.', \"In this regards, rational deterrence theorists have argued that costly signals are required to communicate the credibility of a defending state's resolve.\", 'Costly signals are those actions and statements that clearly increase the risk of a military conflict and also increase the costs of backing down from a deterrent threat.', 'States that are bluffing will be unwilling to cross a certain threshold of threat and military action for fear of committing themselves to an armed conflict.', 'Reputations for resolve .', 'There are three different arguments that have been developed in relation to the role of reputations in influencing deterrence outcomes.', \"The first argument focuses on a defending state's past behaviour in international disputes and crises, which creates strong beliefs in a potential attacking state about the defending state's expected behaviour in future conflicts.\", \"The credibilities of a defending state's policies are arguably linked over time, and reputations for resolve have a powerful causal impact on an attacking state's decision whether to challenge either general or immediate deterrence.\", 'The second approach argues that reputations have a limited impact on deterrence outcomes because the credibility of deterrence is heavily determined by the specific configuration of military capabilities, interests at stake, and political constraints faced by a defending state in a given situation of attempted deterrence.', \"The argument of this school of thought is that potential attacking states are not likely to draw strong inferences about a defending states resolve from prior conflicts because potential attacking states do not believe that a defending state's past behaviour is a reliable predictor of future behaviour.\", 'The third approach is a middle ground between the first two approaches.', 'It argues that potential attacking states are likely to draw reputational inferences about resolve from the past behaviour of defending states only under certain conditions.', 'The insight is the expectation that decision makers will use only certain types of information when drawing inferences about reputations, and an attacking state updates and revises its beliefs when the unanticipated behaviour of a defending state cannot be explained by case-specific variables.', 'Interests at stake .', 'Although costly signaling and bargaining power are more well established arguments in rational deterrence theory, the interests of defending states are not as well known, and attacking states may look beyond the short term bargaining tactics of a defending state and seek to determine what interests are at stake for the defending state that would justify the risks of a military conflict.', 'The argument here is that defending states that have greater interests at stake in a dispute will be more resolved to use force and be more willing to endure military losses in order to secure those interests.', 'Even less well established arguments are the specific interests that are more salient to state leaders such as military interests versus economic interests.', 'Furthermore, Huth argues that both supporters and critics of rational deterrence theory agree that an unfavourable assessment of the domestic and international status quo by state leaders can undermine or severely test the success of deterrence.', 'In a rational choice approach, if the expected utility of not using force is reduced by a declining status quo position, then deterrence failure is more likely, since the alternative option of using force becomes relatively more attractive.', 'Schelling is prescriptive in outlining the impact of the development of nuclear power in the analysis of military power and deterrence.', 'Nuclear weapons give nations the potential to not only destroy their enemies but humanity itself without drawing immediate reprisal because of the lack of a conceivable defense system and the speed with which nuclear weapons can be deployed.', \"A nation's credible threat of such severe damage empowers their deterrence policies and fuels political coercion and military deadlock, which in turn can produce proxy warfare.\", 'United States policy of deterrence during the Cold War underwent significant variations.', 'The early stages of the Cold War were generally characterized by ideology of containment, an aggressive stance on behalf of the United States especially regarding developing nations under their sphere of influence.', 'This period was characterized by numerous proxy wars throughout most of the globe, particularly Africa, Asia, Central America, and South America.', 'A notable such conflict was the Korean War.', 'In contrast to general opinion, George F. Kennan, who is taken to be the founder of this ideology in the famous Long Telegram, asserted that his ideas had been misinterpreted and that he never advocated military intervention, merely economic support.', 'With the US pullout in Vietnam, the normalization of US relations with China, and the Sino-Soviet Split, the policy of Containment was abandoned and a new policy of détente was established, whereby peaceful coexistence was sought between the United States and the Soviet Union.', 'Although all factors listed above contributed to this shift, the most important factor was probably the rough parity achieved in stockpiling nuclear weapons with the clear capability of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD).', 'Therefore, the period of détente was characterized by a general reduction in the tension between the Soviet Union and the United States and a thawing of the Cold War, lasting from the late 1960s until the start of the 1980s.', 'The doctrine of mutual nuclear deterrence characterized relations between the United States and the Soviet Union during this period, and present relations with Russia.', \"A third shift occurred with President Ronald Reagan's arms build-up during the 1980s.\", 'Reagan attempted to justify this policy in part due to concerns of growing Soviet influence in Latin America and the new republic of Iran, established after the Iranian Revolution of 1979.', 'Similar to the old policy of containment, the United States funded several proxy wars, including support for Saddam Hussein of Iraq during the Iran–Iraq War, support for the mujahideen in Afghanistan, who were fighting for independence from the Soviet Union, and several anti-communist movements in Latin America such as the overthrow of the Sandinista government in Nicaragua.', 'The funding of the Contras in Nicaragua led to the Iran-Contra Affair, while overt support led to a ruling from the International Court of Justice against the United States in Nicaragua v. United States.', 'While the army was dealing with the breakup of the Soviet Union and the spread of nuclear technology to other nations beyond the United States and Russia, the concept of deterrence took on a broader multinational dimension.', 'The US policy on post–Cold War deterrence was outlined in 1995 in a document called \"Essentials of Post–Cold War Deterrence\" .', 'This document explains that while relations with Russia continue to follow the traditional characteristics of Mutual Nuclear Deterrence, due to both nations continuing MAD, US policy of deterrence towards nations with minor nuclear capabilities should ensure through threats of immense retaliation (or even preemptive action) that they do not threaten the United States, its interests, or allies.', 'The document explains that such threats must also be used to ensure that nations without nuclear technology refrain from developing nuclear weapons and that a universal ban precludes any nation from maintaining chemical or biological weapons.', 'The current tensions with Iran and North Korea over their nuclear programs are due in part to the continuation of this policy of deterrence.', 'Deterrence theory is criticized for its assumptions about opponent rationales.', 'First, it is argued that suicidal or psychotic opponents may not be deterred by either forms of deterrence .', 'Second, if two enemy states both possess nuclear weapons, Country \"X\" may try to gain a first strike advantage by suddenly launching weapons at Country \"Y\", with a view to destroying its enemy\\'s nuclear launch silos thereby rendering Country \"Y\" incapable of a response.', 'Third, diplomatic misunderstandings and/or opposing political ideologies may lead to escalating mutual perceptions of threat, and a subsequent arms race which elevates the risk of actual war - a scenario illustrated in the movies WarGames and Dr. Strangelove.', 'An arms race is inefficient in its optimal output, as all countries involved expend resources on armaments that would not have been created if the others had not expended resources.', 'This is a form of positive feedback.', 'Fourth, escalation of perceived threat can make it easier for certain measures to be inflicted on a population by its government, such as restrictions on civil liberties, the creation of a military-industrial complex, and military expenditures resulting in higher taxes and increasing budget deficits.', 'In January 2007 a seminal article appeared in the Wall Street Journal, authored by Henry Kissinger, Bill Perry, George Shultz and Sam Nunn.', 'These men were veterans of the cold-war era with impeccable credentials as believers in using nuclear weapons for deterrence.', 'But they now reversed their previous position and asserted that far from making the world safer, nuclear weapons had become a source of extreme risk: .', 'The risk of accidents, misjudgments or unauthorised launches, they argued, was growing more acute in a world of rivalries between relatively new nuclear states that lacked the security safeguards developed over many years by America and the Soviet Union.', 'The emergence of pariah states, such as North Korea (possibly soon to be joined by Iran), armed with nuclear weapons was adding to the fear as was the declared ambition of terrorists to steal, buy or build a nuclear device.', 'Only by a concerted effort to free the world of nuclear weapons could the terrifying trend be reversed .', 'A new form of criticism emerged in the late 1980s with detailed analyses of the actions of individual leaders and groups of leaders in crisis situations (historical and theoretical).', 'A number of new or nuanced criticisms of \"traditional\" deterrence theory emerged.', 'One was that deterrence theory assumed that both sides had common rational peaceful goals.', 'In some real-life situations, such as the Yom Kippur War, leaders felt that internal or external political considerations forced a conflict.', 'One of the essays in, regarding the internal military and political discussions within the Egyptian high command in 1973, indicates that senior civilian leaders (including Anwar Sadat) believed that they had to fight a war in order to have enough internal political support to negotiate for peace.', 'In another miscalculation, Israel rationalized that the Israeli military dominance would deter any attack, and believed that no rational Syrian or Egyptian leader would attempt such an attack.', \"Sadat felt unable to avoid a war, and Syria's leadership misjudged the military situation and believed they could be victorious.\", 'Israel assumed rational and well-informed opponents with clear objectives, and its deterrence failed.', 'Another observation is that crisis situations can reach a point whereby formerly stabilizing actions such as keeping military units at bases, and low alert levels can be seen as a sign of weakness, which may provoke an enemy to attack during the perceived time of advantage.', 'Thus, an inversion point exists, after which some seemingly stabilizing actions become destabilizing, and some formerly destabilizing actions become stabilizing.', 'Finally, studies of the specific group psychology of several leaders and leader groups, including the Israeli and Arab leaders in 1973 and the Kennedy Administration during the Bay of Pigs Invasion and Cuban Missile Crisis, indicated that in many cases executive groups use poor decision-making techniques and improperly assess available information.', 'These errors can preclude truly rational end-behavior in deterrence situations.']),\n",

in higher demand and greater incomes for members.', 'Members may also receive higher wages through collective bargaining, political influence, or corruption .', 'These supply and demand interactions result in a gradation of wage levels within society that significantly influence economic inequality.', \"Many people believe that differences in ability, such as intelligence, motivation, strength, or charisma, are largely innate and play a significant role in determining an individual's wealth.\", 'Individuals with higher ability are in greater demand increasing the wage of those who have them.', 'Individuals with high abilities might also operate more effectively within society in general, regardless of the labor market.', 'Various studies have been conducted on the correlation between IQ scores and wealth or income.', 'The book IQ and the Wealth of Nations, written by Dr. Richard Lynn, examines this relationship constructing a correlation of 0.82 between average IQ and GDP.', 'Peer-reviewed research papers on the relationship have been criticised harshly.', 'In his book The Mismeasure of Man, Stephen Jay Gould criticized intelligence testing, claiming that the tests and the statistical models used to evaluate them are inherently flawed.', 'There is also the highly contested study The Bell Curve, which provides analysis that intelligence is substantially influenced by both genetics and environment and plays an increasing role in social stratification.', 'Recent advances in epigenetics have led to better understandings of potential human ability and how humans develop .', 'If by \"innate ability\" one means not only the abilities that are conferred by one\\'s particular DNA sequence, but also by the particular way in which the genes are expressed, then parental living conditions, gestation period and early life has a large effect on the innate ability of an individual.', 'Another cause is the rate at which income is taxed coupled with the progressivity of the tax system.', 'A progressive tax is a tax by which the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases .', 'In a progressive tax system, the level of the top tax rate will have a direct impact on the level of inequality within a society, either increasing it or decreasing it.', 'Additionally, a steeper progressivity results in an even more equal distribution of income across the board.', 'The difference between the Gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation.', 'Overall income tax rates in the United States are below the OECD average .', 'There is debate between politicians and economists over the role of tax policy in mitigating or exacerbating wealth inequality.', 'Economists such as Paul Krugman, Peter Orszag, and Emmanuel Saez have argued that tax policy in the post World War II era has indeed increased income inequality by enabling the wealthiest American workers far greater access to capital than lower-income Americans.', 'Other economists and politicians, such as Paul Ryan, do not believe tax policy has created a chasm of wealth between the wealthy, middle, and lower class Americans .', 'Another factor that contributed to the already growing inequality in the 20th century was computerization and growth in technology with electricity replacing manpower.', 'With this growing change in technology, the United States experienced increasing demand for skilled workers to use computers and operate the electrical inventions.', 'This resulted in a rightward shift in the Demand for Skilled Labor Supply, and this created an increase in the relative wages of the skilled compared to the wages of the unskilled workers.', 'Such a change in wages added to the inequality that was already present.', 'Martin Ford, author of The Lights in the Tunnel: Automation, Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future, argues that income inequality is likely to continue increasing as more jobs become susceptible to automation.', 'As robotics and artificial intelligence develop further, even many skilled jobs may be threatened.', 'Technologies such as machine learning may ultimately allow computers to do many knowledge-based jobs that require significant education.', 'This may result in substantial unemployment at all skill levels, stagnant or falling wages for most workers, and increased concentration of income and wealth as the owners of capital capture an ever larger fraction of the economy.', 'This in turn could lead to depressed consumer spending and economic growth as the bulk of the population lacks sufficient discretionary income to purchase the products and services produced by the economy; see Surplus value.', \"One important factor in the creation of inequality is variation in individuals' access to education.\", 'Education, especially in an area where there is a high demand for workers, creates high wages for those with this education.', 'As a result, those who are unable to afford an education, or choose not to pursue optional education, generally receive much lower wages.', 'During the mass high school education movement from 1910–1940, there was an increase in skilled workers which led to a decrease in the price of skilled labor.', 'High school education during the period was designed to equip students with necessary skill sets to be able to perform at work.', 'In fact, it differs from the present high school education, which is regarded as a stepping stone to acquire college and advanced degrees.', 'This decrease in wages caused a period of compression and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled workers.', 'John Schmitt and Ben Zipperer (2006) of the CEPR point to economic liberalism and the reduction of business regulation along with the decline of union membership as one of the causes of economic inequality.', 'In an analysis of the effects of intensive Anglo-American neoliberal policies in comparison to continental European neoliberalism, where unions have remained strong, they concluded \"The U.S. economic and social model is associated with substantial levels of social exclusion, including high levels of income inequality, high relative and absolute poverty rates, poor and unequal educational outcomes, poor health outcomes, and high rates of crime and incarceration.', 'At the same time, the available evidence provides little support for the view that U.S.-style labor-market flexibility dramatically improves labor-market outcomes.', 'Despite popular prejudices to the contrary, the U.S. economy consistently affords a lower level of economic mobility than all the continental European countries for which data is available.\" .', 'Trade liberalization may shift economic inequality from a global to a domestic scale .', 'When rich countries trade with poor countries, the low-skilled workers in the rich countries may see reduced wages as a result of the competition, while low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages.', 'Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States.', 'He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable.', 'However, he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation, a view shared by other experts.', 'Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5-15% of rising income inequality.', 'Some economists, such as Robert Lawrence, dispute any such relationship.', 'Lawrence, in particular, argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low-skilled jobs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations, and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low-skilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition from poor countries .', 'The existence of different genders, races and cultures within a society is also thought to contribute to economic inequality.', 'Some psychologists such as Richard Lynn argue that there are innate group differences in ability that are partially responsible for producing race and gender group differences in wealth (see also race and intelligence, sex and intelligence) though this assertion is highly controversial.', 'The concept of the gender gap also tries to explain differences in income between genders.', 'Culture and religion are thought to play a role in creating inequality by either encouraging or discouraging wealth-acquiring behavior, and by providing a basis for discrimination.', 'In many countries individuals belonging to certain racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to be poor.', 'Proposed causes include cultural differences amongst different races, an educational achievement gap, and racism.', 'In many countries, there is a gender income gap which favors males in the labor market.', 'For example, the median full-time salary for U.S. women is 77% of that of U.S. men.', 'Several factors other than discrimination may contribute to this gap.', 'On average, women are more likely than men to consider factors other than pay when looking for work, and may be less willing to travel or relocate .', 'Thomas Sowell, in his book Knowledge and Decisions, claims that this difference is due to women not taking jobs due to marriage or pregnancy, but income studies show that that does not explain the entire difference.', 'Men are far more likely to engage in dangerous occupations which often pay more than positions desired and sought by women .', 'The U.S. Census\\'s report on the wage gap reported \"When we account for difference between male and female work patterns as well as other key factors, women earned, on average, 80 percent of what men earned in 2000.. Even after accounting for key factors that affect earnings, our model could not explain all of the differences in earnings between men and women.\"', 'The income gap in other countries ranges from 53% in Botswana to -40% in Bahrain .', 'In the United States, among women and men who never marry or have children, women make more than men .', 'Additionally, women who work part-time make more on average than men who work part-time .', 'Gender inequality and discrimination is argued to cause and perpetuate poverty and vulnerability in society as a whole .', \"Household and intra-household knowledge and resources are key influences in individuals' abilities to take advantage of external livelihood opportunities or respond appropriately to threats .\", 'High education levels and social integration significantly improve the productivity of all members of the household and improve equity throughout society.', 'Gender Equity Indices seek to provide the tools to demonstrate this feature of poverty .', 'Simon Kuznets argued that levels of economic inequality are in large part the result of stages of development.', 'Kuznets saw a curve-like relationship between level of income and inequality, now known as Kuznets curve.', 'According to Kuznets, countries with low levels of development have relatively equal distributions of wealth.', 'As a country develops, it acquires more capital, which leads to the owners of this capital having more wealth and income and introducing inequality.', 'Eventually, through various possible redistribution mechanisms such as social welfare programs, more developed countries move back to lower levels of inequality.', 'Kuznets demonstrated this relationship using cross-sectional data.', 'However, more recent testing of this theory with superior panel data has shown it to be very weak.', \"Kuznets' curve predicts that income inequality will eventually decrease given time.\", 'As an example, income inequality did fall in the United States during its High School Movement in the 1940s and after.', 'However, recent data shows that the level of income inequality began to rise after the 1970s.', \"This does not necessarily disprove Kuznets' theory.\", \"It may be possible that another Kuznets' cycle is occurring, specifically the move from the manufacturing sector to the service sector.\", \"This implies that it may be possible for multiple Kuznets' cycles to be in effect at any given time.\", 'Related to cultural issues, diversity of preferences within a society often contributes to economic inequality.', 'When faced with the choice between working harder to earn more money or enjoying more leisure time, equally capable individuals with identical earning potential often choose different strategies.', 'This leads to economic inequality even in societies with perfect equality in abilities and circumstances.', 'The trade-off between work and leisure is particularly important in the supply side of the labor market in labor economics.', 'Likewise, individuals in a society often have different levels of risk aversion.', 'When equally-able individuals undertake risky activities with the potential of large payoffs, such as starting new businesses, some ventures succeed and some fail.', 'The presence of both successful and unsuccessful ventures in a society results in economic inequality even when all individuals are identical.', 'Wealth concentration is a theoretical process by which, under certain conditions, newly-created wealth concentrates in the possession of already-wealthy individuals or entities.', 'According to this theory, those who already hold wealth have the means to invest in new sources of creating wealth or to otherwise leverage the accumulation of wealth, thus are the beneficiaries of the new wealth.', 'Over time, wealth condensation can significantly contribute to the persistence of inequality within society.', 'As an example of wealth concentration, truck drivers who own their own trucks often make more money than those who do not, since the owner of a truck can escape the rent charged to drivers by owners (even taking into account maintenance and other costs).', 'Hence, a truck driver who has wealth to begin with can afford to buy his own truck in order to make more money.', 'A truck driver who does not own his own truck makes a lesser wage and is therefore stuck in a Catch-22, unable to buy his own truck to increase his income.', 'As another example of wealth concentration, savings from the upper-income groups tend to accumulate much faster than saving from the lower-income groups.', 'Upper-income groups can save a significant portion of their incomes.', 'On the other hand, lower-income groups barely make enough to cover their consumptions, hence only capable of saving a fraction of their incomes or even none.', 'Assuming both groups earn the same yield rate on their savings, the return on upper-income groups’ savings are much greater than the lower-income groups’ savings because upper-income groups have a much larger base.', 'Related to wealth concentration are the effects of intergenerational inequality and housing inequality.', 'The rich tend to provide their offspring with a better education, increasing their chances of achieving a high income.', 'Furthermore, the wealthy often leave their offspring with a hefty inheritance, jump-starting the process of wealth condensation for the next generation.', \"However, it has been contended by some sociologists such as Charles Murray that this has little effect on one's long-term outcome and that innate ability is by far the best determinant of one's lifetime outcome.\", \"In his 1985 book Regular Economic Cycles: Money, Inflation, Regulation and Depressions, Ravi Batra argues that a growing concentration of wealth, measured as the 'share of wealth held by the richest 1 percent', is linked to bank failures and depressions.\", 'In Table 1 on page 127, there is data for this measure for the years 1810-1969, showing a rise in this measure prior to the 1929 stock market crash. \"..', 'as the concentration of wealth rises, the number of banks with relatively shaky loans also rises.', 'And the higher the concentration, the greater is the number of potential bank failures.\"', 'Batra predicted the same would happen if the 1% share rose again.', \"Some Austrian school economists have theorized that high inflation, caused by a country's monetary policy, can contribute to economic inequality .\", 'This theory argues that inflation of the money supply is a coercive measure that favors those who already have an earning capacity, disfavoring those on fixed income or with savings, thus aggravating inequality.', 'They cite examples of correlation between inflation and inequality and note that inflation can be caused independently by \"printing money\", suggesting causation of inequality by inflation.', 'Entrenched strata of power — whether economic, political, status, ascribed, or meritocratic — can lead to decreased mobility by the assertion of that power, and lead to increased inequality.', 'Many factors constrain economic inequality—they may be divided into two classes: government sponsored, and market driven.', 'The relative merits and effectiveness of each approach is a subject of debate.', 'Typical government initiatives to reduce economic inequality include: .', 'Public education: increasing the supply of skilled labor and reducing income inequality due to education differentials .', 'Progressive taxation: the rich are taxed proportionally more than the poor, reducing the amount of income inequality in society .', 'Minimum wage legislation: raising the income of the poorest workers \\nNationalization or subsidization of products: providing goods and services that everyone needs cheaply or freely (such as food, healthcare, and housing), governments can effectively raise the purchasing power of the poorer members of society.', 'These provisions may lower inequality, but have sometimes resulted in increased economic inequality (as in the Soviet Union, where the distribution of these government benefits was controlled by a privileged class).', 'Political scientists have argued that public policy controlled by organizations of the wealthy have steadily eroded economic equality in the US since the 1970s . .', 'Market forces outside of government intervention that can reduce economic inequality include: .', 'propensity to spend: with rising wealth &#38; income, a person must spend more.', 'In an extreme example, if one person owned everything, they would immediately need to hire people to maintain their properties, thus reducing the wealth concentration .', 'Unionization: although not a market force, per se, labor organizations may reduce inequality by negotiating standard pay rates (though probably increasing unemployment).', 'As union power has declined, and performance related pay has become more widespread, economic inequality has mirrored productive inequality .', 'Research has shown an inverse link between income inequality and social cohesion.', 'In more equal societies, people are much more likely to trust each other, measures of social capital suggest greater community involvement, and homicide rates are consistently lower.', 'In a 2002 paper, Eric Uslaner and Mitchell Brown showed that there is a high correlation between the amount of trust in society and the amount of income equality.', 'They did this by comparing results from the question \"would others take advantage of you if they got the chance?\"', 'in U.S General Social Survey and others with statistics on income inequality.', 'Similarly, a 2008 article by Andersen and Fetner finds a strong relationship between economic inequality within and across countries and tolerance for 35 democracies.', 'Robert Putnam, professor of political science at Harvard, established links between social capital and economic inequality.', 'His most important studies (Putnam, Leonardi, and Nanetti 1993, Putnam 2000) established these links in both the United States and in Italy.', 'On the relationship of inequality and involvement in community he says: .', 'In addition to affecting levels of trust and civic engagement, inequality in society has also shown to be highly correlated with crime rates.', 'Most studies looking into the relationship between crime and inequality have concentrated on homicides—since homicides are almost identically defined across all nations and jurisdictions.', 'There have been over fifty studies showing tendencies for violence to be more common in societies where income differences are larger.', 'Research has been conducted comparing developed countries with undeveloped countries, as well as studying areas within countries.', 'Daly et al.', '2001 .', 'found that among U.S States and Canadian Provinces there is a tenfold difference in homicide rates related to inequality.', 'They estimated that about half of all variation in homicide rates can be accounted for by differences in the amount of inequality in each province or state.', 'Fajnzylber et al.

Wilkinson and Kate Pickett has also presented evidence that both social cohesion and health problems are greater in countries or states where economic inequality is highest.', 'For instance, crime rates, mental health problems and teen-age pregnancies are lower in countries like Japan and Finland compared to countries with greater inequality such as the US and UK .', 'Recently, there has been increasing interest from epidemiologists on the subject of economic inequality and its relation to the health of populations.', 'There is a very robust correlation between socioeconomic status and health.', 'This correlation suggests that it is not only the poor who tend to be sick when everyone else is healthy, but that there is a continual gradient, from the top to the bottom of the socio-economic ladder, relating status to health.', 'This phenomenon is often called the \"SES Gradient\".', 'Lower socioeconomic status has been linked to chronic stress, heart disease, ulcers, type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, certain types of cancer, and premature aging.', 'There is debate regarding the cause of the SES Gradient.', 'A number of researchers (A.

Clarkwest—see also Russell Sage working papers) see a definite link between economic status and mortality due to the greater economic resources of the wealthy, but they find little correlation due to social status differences.', 'Other researchers such as Richard G.

Kaplan have found that socioeconomic status strongly affects health even when controlling for economic resources and access to health care .', 'Most famous for linking social status with health are the Whitehall studies - a series of studies conducted on civil servants in London.', 'The studies found that although all civil servants in England have the same access to health care, there was a strong correlation between social status and health.', 'The studies found that this relationship remained strong even when controlling for health-affecting habits such as exercise, smoking and drinking.', 'Furthermore, it has been noted that no amount of medical attention will help decrease the likelihood of someone getting type 2 diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis - yet both are more common among populations with lower socioeconomic status.', \"Lastly, it has been found that amongst the wealthiest quarter of countries on earth (a set stretching from Luxembourg to Slovakia) there is no relation between a country's wealth and general population health - suggesting that past a certain level, absolute levels of wealth have little impact on population health, but relative levels within a country do.\", 'The concept of psychosocial stress attempts to explain how psychosocial phenomena such as status and social stratification can lead to the many diseases associated with the SES Gradient.', 'Higher levels of economic inequality tend to intensify social hierarchies and generally degrade the quality of social relations—leading to greater levels of stress and stress-related diseases.', 'Richard Wilkinson found this to be true not only for the poorest members of society, but also for the wealthiest.', \"Economic inequality is bad for everyone's health.\", 'The effects of inequality on health are not limited to human populations.', 'David H. Abbott at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center found that among many primate species, less egalitarian social structures correlated with higher levels of stress hormones among socially subordinate individuals.', 'Economic inequality is thought to reduce distributive efficiency within society.', 'That is to say, inequality reduces the sum total of personal utility because of the decreasing marginal utility of wealth.', 'For example, a house may provide less utility to a single millionaire as a summer home than it would to a homeless family of five.', 'The marginal utility of wealth is lowest among the richest.', 'In other words, an additional dollar spent by a poor person will go to things providing a great deal of utility to that person, such as basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare; meanwhile, an additional dollar spent by a much richer person will most likely go to things providing relatively less utility to that person, such as luxury items.', 'From this standpoint, for any given amount of wealth in society, a society with more equality will have higher aggregate utility.', 'Some studies (Layard 2003;Blanchard and Oswald 2000, 2003) have found evidence for this theory, noting that in societies where inequality is lower, population-wide satisfaction and happiness tend to be higher.', 'Economist Arthur Cecil Pigou discussed the impact of inequality in The Economics of Welfare.', 'He wrote:\\nNevertheless, it is evident that any transference of income from a relatively rich man to a relatively poor man of similar temperament, since it enables more intense wants, to be satisfied at the expense of less intense wants, must increase the aggregate sum of satisfaction.', 'The old \"law of diminishing utility\" thus leads securely to the proposition: Any cause which increases the absolute share of real income in the hands of the poor, provided that it does not lead to a contraction in the size of the national dividend from any point of view, will, in general, increase economic welfare.', 'In addition to the argument based on diminishing marginal utility, Pigou makes a second argument that income generally benefits the rich by making them wealthier than other people, whereas the poor benefit in absolute terms.', 'Pigou writes:\\nNow the part played by comparative, as distinguished from absolute, income is likely to be small for incomes that only suffice to provide the necessaries and primary comforts of life, but to be large with large incomes.', 'In other words, a larger proportion of the satisfaction yielded by the incomes of rich people comes from their relative, rather than from their absolute, amount.', 'This part of it will not be destroyed if the incomes of all rich people are diminished together.', 'The loss of economic welfare suffered by the rich when command over resources is transferred from them to the poor will, therefore, be substantially smaller relatively to the gain of economic welfare to the poor than a consideration of the law of diminishing utility taken by itself suggests. --', '.', 'Schmidtz (2006) argues that maximizing the sum of individual utilities does not necessarily imply that the maximum social utility is achieved.', 'For example: .', 'A society that takes Joe Rich’s second unit [of corn] is taking that unit away from someone who . .', 'has nothing better to do than plant it and giving it to someone who . .', 'does have something better to do with it.', 'That sounds good, but in the process, the society takes seed corn out of production and diverts it to food, thereby cannibalizing itself .', 'Firstly, certain costs are difficult to avoid and are shared by everyone, such as the costs of housing, pensions, education and health care .', 'If the state does not provide these services, then for those on lower incomes, the costs must be borrowed and often those on lower incomes are those who are worse equipped to manage their finances .', 'Secondly, aspirational consumption describes the process of middle income earners aspiring to achieve the standards of living enjoyed by their wealthier counterparts and one method of achieving this aspiration is by taking on debt .', 'The result leads to even greater inequality and potential economic instability .', 'Many people accept inequality as a given, and argue that an increased gap between rich and poor increases the incentives for competition and innovation within an economy.', 'Some modern economic theories, such as the neoclassical school, have suggested that a functioning economy entails a certain level of unemployment.', 'These theories argue that unemployment benefits must be below the wage level to provide an incentive to work, thereby mandating inequality and that additionally, it is impossible to lower unemployment down to zero.', 'Hypotheses such as socialism, dispute this positive role of unemployment.', 'Many economists believe that one of the main reasons that inequality might induce economic incentive is because material well-being and conspicuous consumption are related to status.', 'In this view, high stratification of income (high inequality) creates high amounts of social stratification, leading to greater competition for status.', 'One of the first writers to note this relationship was Adam Smith who recognized \"regard\" as one of the major driving forces behind economic activity.', 'From The Theory of Moral Sentiments in 1759: .', '[W]hat is the end of avarice and ambition, of the pursuit of wealth, of power, and pre-eminence?', 'Is it to supply the necessities of nature?', 'The wages of the meanest labourer can supply them..

bearing on the validity of the theories and are not very informative about the overall effect of inequality.', 'First, these studies examine the effect of inequality beyond its effects through education, fertility, and investment.', 'For instance, Barro (2000) has found that, once controls for education, fertility, and investment are introduced, there is no relationship between inequality and economic growth in the entire sample.', 'His findings, therefore, suggest that inequality does not have a direct effect on growth beyond its effects through education, fertility and investment.', 'In particular, if the control for fertility is dropped in Barro (2000), the effect of inequality on growth is significantly negative, as predicted by the theory.', 'Moreover, these studies examine the effect of inequality in the short run (i.e., the effect of inequality on the average growth rate in the subsequent 5–10 years), while as suggested by the theories, inequality is likely to have a long-run effect (e.g., via the human capital formation).', 'The United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD)’s 2010 report comes to multiple conclusions, some of which concur with

Texas banning any use of race in school admissions, the State of Texas passed a law guaranteeing entry to any state university of a student's choice if they finished in the top 10% of their graduating class.\", 'Florida and California have also replaced racial quotas with class rank and other programs.', 'Class rank tends to benefit top students at less competitive high schools, to the detriment of students at more competitive high schools.', 'This effect, however, may be intentional, as less-funded, less competitive schools are more likely to be schools where minority enrollment is high.', \"Critics argue that class rank is more a measure of one's peers than of one's self.\", 'The top-10% rule also adds racial diversity only because schools are still highly racially segregated .', 'Additionally, the class rank rule has the same consequence as traditional affirmative action: opening schools to students who would otherwise not be admitted had the given school used a holistic, merit-based approach .', 'From 1996 to 1998, Texas had entirely merit-based admission to its state universities, and minority enrollment was low; adopting the \"top 10 percent\" rule returned minority enrollment to pre-1996 levels .', 'In 2006, Jian Li, a Chinese undergraduate at Yale University, filed a civil rights complaint with the Office for Civil Rights against Princeton University, claiming that his race played a role in their decision to reject his application for admission, and seeking the suspension of federal financial assistance to the university until it \"discontinues discrimination against Asian-Americans in all forms\" by eliminating race and legacy preferences.', 'Princeton Dean of Admissions Janet Rapelye responded to the claims in the 30 November 2006 issue of the Daily Princetonian by stating that \"the numbers don\\'t indicate [discrimination]\" and that Li was not admitted because \"Many others had far better qualifications.\"', 'Li\\'s extracurriculars were described as \"not all that outstanding\" .', \"Li countered in an email, saying that his placement on the waitlist undermines Rapelye's claim. “\", 'Princeton had initially waitlisted my application,” Li said. “', 'So if it were not for a yield which was higher than expected, the admissions office very well may have admitted a candidate whose ‘outside activities were not all that outstanding.’ ”  .'])],\n",
