in poor families .', 'These programs have also helped to increase school enrollment and attendance and they also have shown improvements in children’s health conditions .', 'Most of these transfer schemes are now benefiting around 110 million people in the region, and are considered relatively cheap, costing around 0.5% of their GDP .', 'These outcomes represent an increase in the investment of human capital, thus becoming a very important tool for reducing the inter-generational transmission of inequality.', 'However, studies by the UNDP have shown that conditional cash transfers did not represent a significant increase in the quality of education and in learning, nor in significant increases in salaries, once the recipients entered the labor force .', 'CCT Programs have been proved to be very well-targeted and effective in reaching the poor and the excluded groups, notably the extreme poor living outside the reach of social protection programs tied with formal sector employment The programs have also promoted equality of gender since they provide larger funds to girls given that it is common that they tend to drop out earlier from school, so this has increased their enrollment and attendance to secondary levels of education.', 'In the long run, these investments may also yield to significant changes in women’s empowerment and insertion in economic networks .', 'However, it has been critiqued that these programs do not serve the needs of other marginalized groups, such as some indigenous people and poor families living in certain rural areas, since they live too far away from schools and health centers to effectively comply with the program conditions .', 'More recent pilot adaptations are testing CCTs in a diverse range of settings including a growing list of low income countries, urban settings, and for more specialized purposes.', 'CCT Programs are efficient tools for reducing poverty and inequality but only in the short term.', 'Hence, it is important that these programs are coordinated with other social programs in ortder to strengthen synergies in poverty alleviation.', 'The progrmas should be linked with programs that support labor market insertion and employment to provide incentives for graduation and opportunities for moving out of poverty.', 'For example, Chile’s Programa Puente targets the 100,000 poorest and most excluded families in urban areas and provides beneficiaries with the support of a social worker for two years.', 'While the monetary value of the transfer is relatively low (US$ 22 PPP 2003 per family per month), the program aims at inserting families into the wider safety net through a tailored plan of conditionalities.', 'Similarly, Bolsa-Família in Brazil seeks to promote local synergies by linking the beneficiaries to preferential housing, micro-credit and local business development, and Oportunidades in Mexico piloted various expansions to the basic \\nprogram through the Plataforma

used to purchase food.', 'The debate on the use of cash rather than food has been receiving renewed attention in recent years, in part because of changing donor practices.', 'In parallel there has been growing attention on the appropriateness of food transfers taking into account a number of concerns, e.g. impacts on food markets, transaction costs, type and size of transfers, and preferences of beneficiaries.', 'Supplementary feeding programs provide a direct transfer of food to target households or individuals.', 'The food may be prepared and eaten on-site (e.g., in child feeding centers

pay attention in class.', 'They vary from the provision of breakfast, lunch or a midmorning snack, to a combination of these.', 'School feeding programs are often integrated with health and nutrition education, parasite treatment, health screening, and provision of water and sanitation.', 'Food for work (FFW) programs provide food rations in exchange for a given amount of work done.', 'FFW programs have long been used to protect households against the decline in purchasing power that often accompanies seasonal unemployment, drought, and other periodic disruptions.', 'Emergency food

'However, these definitions are usually coupled with descriptions of the type of harm or the use of diagnostic criteria.', 'According to DSM-IV, Pathological gambling is now defined as separate from a manic episode.', 'Only when the gambling occurs independent of other impulsive, mood, or thought disorders is it considered its own diagnosis.', 'In order to be diagnosed, an individual must have at least five of the following symptoms: .', 'Preoccupation.', 'The subject has frequent thoughts about gambling experiences, whether past, future, or fantasy.', 'Tolerance.', 'As with drug tolerance, the subject requires larger or more frequent wagers to experience the same \"rush\".', 'Withdrawal.', 'Restlessness or irritability associated with attempts to cease or reduce gambling.', 'Escape.', 'The subject gambles to improve mood or escape problems.', 'Chasing.', 'The subject tries to win back gambling losses with more gambling.', 'Lying.', 'The subject tries to hide the extent of his or her gambling by lying to family, friends, or therapists.', 'Loss of control.', 'The person has unsuccessfully attempted to reduce gambling.', 'Illegal acts.', 'The person has broken the law in order to obtain gambling money or recover gambling losses.', 'This may include acts of theft, embezzlement, fraud, or forgery.', 'Risked significant relationship.', 'The person gambles despite risking or losing a relationship, job, or other significant opportunity.', 'Bailout.', 'The person turns to family, friends, or another third party for financial assistance as a result of gambling.', 'As with many disorders, the DSM-IV definition of pathological gambling is widely accepted and used as a basis for research and clinical practice internationally.', 'According to the Illinois Institute for Addiction Recovery, recent evidence indicates that pathological gambling is an addiction similar to chemical addiction.', 'It has been seen that some pathological gamblers have lower levels of norepinephrine than normal gamblers.', 'According to a logical study conducted by Alec Roy, M.D. formerly at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, norepinephrine is secreted under stress, arousal, or thrill, so pathological gamblers gamble to make up for their under-dosage.', 'Further to this, according to a report from the Harvard Medical School Division on Addictions there was an experiment constructed where test subjects were presented with situations where they could win, lose or break even in a casino-like environment.', \"Subjects' reactions were measured using fMRI, a neuro-imaging technique very similar to MRI.\", 'And according to Hans Breiter, MD, co-director of the motivation and Emotion Neuroscience Centre at the Massachusetts General Hospital, \"Monetary reward in a gambling-like experiment produces brain activation very similar to that observed in a cocaine addict receiving an infusion of cocaine.\"', 'However, studies have compared gamblers to substance-dependent addicts, concluding that addicted gamblers display more physical symptoms during withdrawal .', 'Deficiencies in serotonin might also contribute to compulsive behavior, including a gambling addictions.', \"It is believed that gambling addiction may, in part, be influenced by the gambler's own erroneous beliefs about the nature of probability.\", 'If one approaches gambling with the intent of winning and they initially end up losing, the only way for them to break even or win in the long run is to keep playing .', 'Problem gamblers have the erroneous belief that if they keep playing, they will eventually win.', 'While it is logically correct to say that more trials of a probabilistic event increase the likelihood of the event occurring at least once, some hold the fallacious belief that previous failures influence the likelihood of future successes.', 'If individual incidences of probabilistic events are independent of each other, then this belief is incorrect.', \"To hold such a belief is to commit the Gambler's Fallacy.\", 'As an example, there is a 63.3% chance that a slot machine with a 1:100 likelihood of paying out each pull will have paid out once or more after 100 pulls.', 'There is a 39.5% chance that this same machine will have paid out at least once after 50 pulls.', \"A problem gambler that is susceptible to the gambler's fallacy would believe that, if after 50 pulls the slot machine has not paid out, there is a 63.3% likelihood that the machine will pay out within the next 50 pulls, because there is a 63.3% chance of the machine paying out within any particular block of 100 trials.\", 'In reality, the likelihood that the machine will pay out in the next 50 pulls is 39.5%.', 'The oversight made here is that independent probabilistic events do not actually influence one another.', 'Gamblers are equating a posteriori probability with a priori probability.', 'Gamblers believe that if there is a certain likelihood of a probabilistic event occurring after a certain number of trials, then as the number of past failures increases, the likelihood of the event occurring in future trials increases.', 'The reality of the situation is that once a particular trial has been deemed a failure, we know a posteriori that there is a 0% chance of that event occurring, even if a priori there is a 1% chance of the event occurring.', 'Within a particular set of 100 pulls, after 50 pulls we are no longer in a block of 100 1:100 events, but a block of 50 0:100 events and 50 1:100 events.', 'This erroneous belief should be considered at least partly responsible for gambling addiction because the false belief that a payout should be coming soon because one has been playing for so long provides a rational, though poorly informed explanation for why someone may be unwilling to stop playing.', 'Pathological gambling is similar to many other impulse control disorders such as kleptomania, pyromania, and trichotillomania.', 'Other mental diseases that also exhibit impulse control disorder include such mental disorders as antisocial personality disorder, or schizophrenia.', 'According to evidence from both community- and clinic-based studies, individuals who have pathological gambling are highly likely to exhibit other psychiatric problems at the same time, including substance use disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, or personality disorders .', 'As debts build up people turn to other sources of money such as theft, or the sale of drugs.', 'A lot of this pressure comes from bookies or loan sharks that people rely on for capital to gamble with.', 'In a 1995 survey of 184 Gamblers Anonymous members in Illinois, Illinois State Professor Henry Lesieur found that 56 percent admitted to some illegal act to obtain money to gamble.', 'Fifty-eight percent admitted they wrote bad checks, while 44 percent said they stole or embezzled money from their employer .', 'Compulsive gambling is often very detrimental to personal relationships.', 'In a 1991 study of relationships of American men, it was found that 10% of compulsive gamblers had been married more than twice.', 'Only 2% of men who did not gamble were married more than twice .', 'Abuse is also common in homes where pathological gambling is present.', 'Growing up in such a situation leads to improper emotional development and increased risk of falling prey to problem gambling behavior.', 'A gambler who does not receive treatment for pathological gambling when in his or her desperation phase may contemplate suicide .', 'Problem gambling is often associated with increased suicidal ideation and attempts compared to the general population .', 'Early onset of problem gambling increases the lifetime risk of suicide .', 'However, gambling-related suicide attempts are usually made by older people with problem gambling .', 'Both comorbid substance use and comorbid mental disorders increase the risk of suicide in people with problem gambling .', \"A 2010 Australian hospital study found that 17% of suicidal patients admitted to the Alfred Hospital's emergency department were problem gamblers .\", 'A study by the United Kingdom Gambling Commission, the \"British Gambling Prevalence Survey 2007\", found that approximately 0.6% of the adult population had problem gambling issues, the same percentage as in 1999.', 'The highest prevalence of problem gambling was found among those who participated in spread betting (14.7%), fixed odds betting terminals (11.2%) and betting exchanges (9.8%) .', 'Available research seems to indicate that problem gambling is an internal tendency, and that problem gamblers will tend to risk money on whatever game is available, rather than a particular game being available inducing problem gambling in otherwise \"normal\" individuals.', 'However, research also indicates that problem gamblers tend to risk money on fast-paced games.', 'Thus a problem gambler is much more likely to lose a lot of money on roulette or slot machines, where rounds end quickly and there is a constant temptation to play again or increase bets, as opposed to a state lottery where the gambler must wait until the next drawing to see results.', 'Dopamine agonists, in particular pramipexole (Mirapex), have been implicated in the development of compulsive gambling and other excessive behavior patterns (e.g., PMID 16009751).', 'The most common instrument used to screen for \"probable pathological gambling\" behavior is the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) developed by Lesieur and Blume (1987) at the South Oaks Hospital in New York City .', 'This screen is undoubtedly the most cited instrument in psychological research literature.', 'In recent years the use of SOGS has declined due to a number of criticisms including that it over-estimates false positives.', 'The DSM-IV diagnostic criteria presented as a checklist is an alternative to SOGS, it focuses on the psychological motivations underpinning problem gambling and was developed by the American Psychiatric Association.', 'It consists of ten diagnostic criteria.', 'One screening measure based upon the DSM-IV criteria is the National Opinion Research Center DSM Screen for Gambling Problems (NODS).', 'This measure is currently used frequently.', 'The Canadian Problem Gambling Inventory (CPGI) is another newer assessment measure.', 'The Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) is composed of nine items from the longer CPGI.', 'The PGSI focuses on the harms and consequences associated with problem gambling.', 'Most treatment for problem gambling involves counseling, step-based programs, self-help, peer-support, medication, or a combination of these.', 'However, no one treatment is considered to be most efficacious and no medications have been approved for the treatment of pathological gambling by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).', 'Gamblers Anonymous (GA) is a commonly used treatment for gambling problems.', 'Modeled after Alcoholics Anonymous, GA uses a 12-step model that emphasizes a mutual-support approach.', 'One form of counseling, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to reduce symptoms and gambling-related urges.', 'This type of therapy focuses on the identification of gambling-related thought processes, mood and cognitive distortions that increase one’s vulnerability to out-of-control gambling.', 'Additionally, CBT approaches frequently utilize skill-building techniques geared toward relapse prevention, assertiveness and gambling refusal, problem solving and reinforcement of gambling-inconsistent activities and interests.', 'As to behavioral treatment, some recent research supports the use of both activity scheduling and desentization in the treatment of gambling problems  In general behavior analytic research in this area is growing  .', 'There is evidence that the SSRI paroxetine is efficient in the treatment of pathological gambling .', 'Additionally, for patients suffering from both pathological gambling and a comorbid bipolar spectrum condition, sustained release lithium has shown efficacy in a preliminary trial .', 'The opiate antagonist drug nalmefene has also been trialled quite successfully for the treatment of compulsive gambling.', 'One step-based program for gambling issues is Gamblers Anonymous.', 'Gamblers Anonymous uses a 12-step program adapted from Alcoholics Anonymous and also places an emphasis on peer support.', 'Other step-based programs are specific to gambling and generic to healing addiction, creating financial health, and improving mental wellness.', 'Commercial alternatives, designed for clinical intervention using the best of health science and applied education practices have been used as patient centered tools for intervention since 2007.', 'They include measured efficacy and resulting recovery metrics.', 'A growing method of treatment is peer support.', 'With the advancement of online gambling, many gamblers experiencing issues use various online peer-support groups to aid their recovery.', 'This protects their anonymity whilst allowing to attempt to self-recover often

debut.', 'Only two nuclear weapons have been used in the course of warfare, both by the United States near the end of World War II.', 'On 6 August 1945, a uranium gun-type device code-named \"Little Boy\" was detonated over the Japanese city of Hiroshima.', 'Three days later, on 9 August, a plutonium implosion-type device code-named \"Fat Man\" was exploded over Nagasaki, Japan.', 'These two

admitted to having previous fabricated nuclear weapons in the past, but has since disassembled their arsenal and submitted to international safeguards .', 'The Federation of American Scientists estimates there are more than 20,500 nuclear warheads in the world as of 2011, with around 4,800 of them kept in \"operational\" status, ready for potential use .', 'There are two basic types of nuclear weapons: those which derive the majority of their energy from nuclear fission reactions alone, and those which use fission reactions to begin nuclear fusion reactions that produce a large amount of the total energy output.', 'All existing nuclear weapons derive some of their explosive energy from nuclear fission reactions.', 'Weapons whose explosive output is exclusively from fission reactions are commonly referred to as atomic bombs or atom bombs (abbreviated as A-bombs).', 'This has long been noted as something of a misnomer, however, as their energy comes specifically from the nucleus of the atom.', 'In fission weapons, a mass of fissile material (enriched uranium or plutonium) is assembled into a supercritical mass—the amount of material needed to start an exponentially growing nuclear chain reaction—either by shooting one piece of sub-critical material into another (the \"gun\" method) or by compressing a sub-critical sphere of material using chemical explosives to many times its original density (the \"implosion\" method).', 'The latter approach is considered more sophisticated than the former and only the latter approach can be used if the fissile material is plutonium.', 'A major challenge in all nuclear weapon designs is to ensure that a significant fraction of the fuel is consumed before the weapon destroys itself.', 'The amount of energy released by fission bombs can range from the equivalent of less than a ton of TNT upwards of 500,000 tons (500 kilotons) of TNT .', 'All fission reactions necessarily generate fission products, the radioactive remains of the atomic nuclei split by the fission reactions.', 'Many fission products are either highly radioactive (but short-lived) or moderately radioactive (but long-lived), and as such are a serious form of radioactive contamination if not fully contained.', 'Fission products are the principal radioactive component of nuclear fallout.', 'The most commonly used fissile materials for nuclear weapons applications have been uranium-235 and plutonium-239.', 'Less commonly used has been uranium-233.', 'Neptunium-237 and a number of isotopes of americium may be usable for nuclear explosives as well, but it is not clear that this has ever been actually implemented, and even their plausible use in nuclear weapons is a matter of scientific dispute .', 'The other basic type of nuclear weapon produces a large amount of its energy through nuclear fusion reactions.', 'Such fusion weapons are generally referred to as thermonuclear weapons or more colloquially as hydrogen bombs (abbreviated as H-bombs), as they rely on fusion reactions between isotopes of hydrogen (deuterium and tritium).', 'However, all such weapons derive a significant portion, and sometimes a majority, of their energy from fission.', 'This is because a fission weapon is required as a \"trigger\" for the fusion reactions, and the fusion reactions can themselves trigger additional fission reactions .', \"Only six countries—United States, Russia, United Kingdom, People's Republic of China, France and India—have conducted thermonuclear weapon tests. (\", 'Whether India has detonated a \"true\", multi-staged thermonuclear weapon is controversial.)', 'All thermonuclear weapons are considered to be much more difficult to successfully design and execute than primitive fission weapons.', 'Thermonuclear bombs work by using the energy of a fission bomb to compress and heat fusion fuel.', 'In the Teller-Ulam design, which accounts for all multi-megaton yield hydrogen bombs, this is accomplished by placing a fission bomb and fusion fuel (tritium, deuterium, or lithium deuteride) in proximity within a special, radiation-reflecting container.', 'When the fission bomb is detonated, gamma and X-rays emitted first compress the fusion fuel, then heat it to thermonuclear temperatures.', 'The ensuing fusion reaction creates enormous numbers of high-speed neutrons, which can then induce fission in materials not normally prone to it, such as depleted uranium.', 'Each of these components is known as a \"stage\", with the fission bomb as the \"primary\" and the fusion capsule as the \"secondary\".', 'In large, megaton-range hydrogen bombs, about half of the yield comes from the final fissioning of depleted uranium .', 'By chaining together numerous stages with increasing amounts of fusion fuel, thermonuclear weapons can be made to an almost arbitrary yield; the largest ever detonated (the Tsar Bomba of the USSR) released an energy equivalent of over 50 million tons (50 megatons) of TNT.', 'Most thermonuclear weapons are considerably smaller than this, due to practical constraints arising from the space and weight requirements of missile warheads .', 'Fusion reactions do not create fission products, and thus contribute far less to the creation of nuclear fallout than fission reactions.', 'However, because all thermonuclear weapons contain at least one fission stage, and many high-yield thermonuclear devices have a final fission stage from depleted uranium, thermonuclear weapons can generate at least as much nuclear fallout as fission-only weapons, if not substantially more.', 'There are other types of nuclear weapons as well.', 'For example, a boosted fission weapon is a fission bomb which increases its explosive yield through a small amount of fusion reactions, but it is not a fusion bomb.', 'In the boosted bomb, the neutrons produced by the fusion reactions serve primarily to increase the efficiency of the fission bomb.', 'Some weapons are designed for special purposes; a neutron bomb is a thermonuclear weapon that yields a relatively small explosion but a relatively large amount of neutron radiation; such a device could theoretically be used to cause massive casualties while leaving infrastructure mostly intact and creating a minimal amount of fallout.', 'The detonation of any nuclear weapon is accompanied by a blast of neutron radiation.', 'Surrounding a nuclear weapon with suitable materials (such as cobalt or gold) creates a weapon known as a salted bomb.', 'This device can produce exceptionally large quantities of radioactive contamination.', 'Research has been done into the possibility of pure fusion bombs: nuclear weapons that consisted of fusion reactions without requiring a fission bomb to initiate them.', 'Such a weapon would potentially prove to be a simpler path to thermonuclear weapons than one requiring the development of fission weapons first, and pure fusion weapons would create significantly less nuclear fallout than other thermonuclear weapons, as they would not disperse fission products.', 'In 1998, the United States Department of Energy divulged that the United States had \"made a substantial investment\" in the past to develop pure fusion weapons but that \"the U.S. does not have and is not developing a pure fusion weapon\" and that \"no credible design for a pure fusion weapon resulted from the DOE investment.\" .', 'Most variation in nuclear weapon design is for the purpose of achieving different yields for different situations, and in manipulating design elements to attempt to minimize weapon size .', 'Nuclear weapons delivery—the technology and systems used to bring a nuclear weapon to its target—is an important aspect of nuclear weapons relating both to nuclear weapon design and nuclear strategy.', 'Additionally, development and maintenance of delivery options is among the most resource-intensive aspects of a nuclear weapons program: according to one estimate, deployment costs accounted for 57% of the total financial resources spent by the United States in relation to nuclear weapons since 1940 .', 'Historically the first method of delivery, and the method used in the two nuclear weapons actually used in warfare, was as a gravity bomb, dropped from bomber aircraft.', 'This method is usually the first developed by countries as it does not place many restrictions on the size of the weapon and weapon miniaturization is something which requires considerable weapons design knowledge.', 'It does, however, limit the range of attack, the response time to an impending attack, and the number of weapons which can be fielded at any given time.', 'With the advent of miniaturization, nuclear bombs can be delivered by both strategic bombers and tactical fighter-bombers, allowing an air force to use its current fleet with little or no modification.', 'This method may still be considered the primary means of nuclear weapons delivery; the majority of U.S. nuclear warheads, for example, are free-fall gravity bombs, namely the B61 .', 'More preferable from a strategic point of view is a nuclear weapon mounted onto a missile, which can use a ballistic trajectory to deliver the warhead over the horizon.', 'While even short range missiles allow for a faster and less vulnerable attack, the development of long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) has given some nations the ability to plausibly deliver missiles anywhere on the globe with a high likelihood of success.', 'More advanced systems, such as multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), allow multiple warheads to be launched at different targets from one missile, reducing the chance of a successful missile defense.', 'Today, missiles are most common among systems designed for delivery of nuclear weapons.', 'Making a warhead small enough to fit onto a missile, though, can be a difficult task .', 'Tactical weapons have involved the most variety of delivery types, including not only gravity bombs and missiles but also artillery shells, land mines, and nuclear depth charges and torpedoes for anti-submarine warfare.', 'An atomic mortar was also tested at one time by the United States.', 'Small, two-man portable tactical weapons (somewhat misleadingly referred to as suitcase bombs), such as the Special Atomic Demolition Munition, have been developed, although the difficulty of combining sufficient yield with portability limits their military utility .', 'Nuclear warfare strategy is a set of policies that deal with preventing or fighting a nuclear war.', 'The policy of trying to prevent an attack by a nuclear weapon from another country by threatening nuclear retaliation is known as the strategy of nuclear deterrence.', \"The goal in deterrence is to always maintain a second strike capability (the ability of a country to respond to a nuclear attack with one of its own) and potentially to strive for first strike status (the ability to completely destroy an enemy's nuclear forces before they could retaliate).\", 'During the Cold War, policy and military theorists in nuclear-enabled countries worked out models of what sorts of policies could prevent one from ever being attacked by a nuclear weapon.', 'Different forms of nuclear weapons delivery (see above) allow for different types of nuclear strategies.', 'The goals of any strategy are generally to make it difficult for an enemy to launch a pre-emptive strike against the weapon system and difficult to defend against the delivery of the weapon during a potential conflict.', 'Sometimes this has meant keeping the weapon locations hidden, such as deploying them on submarines or rail cars whose locations are very hard for an enemy to track and other times this means protecting them by burying them in hardened bunkers.', 'Other components of nuclear strategies have included using missile defense (to destroy the missiles before they land) or implementation of civil defense measures (using early-warning systems to evacuate citizens to safe areas before an attack).', 'Note that weapons which are designed to threaten large populations or to generally deter attacks are known as strategic weapons.', 'Weapons which are designed to actually be used on a battlefield in military situations are known as tactical weapons.', 'There are critics of the very idea of nuclear strategy for waging nuclear war who have suggested that a nuclear war between two nuclear powers would result in mutual annihilation.', 'From this point of view, the significance of nuclear weapons is purely to deter war because any nuclear war would immediately escalate out of mutual distrust and fear, resulting in mutually assured destruction.', 'This threat of national, if not global, destruction has been a strong motivation for anti-nuclear weapons activism.', 'Critics from the peace movement and within the military establishment have questioned the usefulness of such weapons in the current military climate.', 'According to an advisory opinion issued by the International Court of Justice in 1996, the use of (or threat of use of) such weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, but the court did not reach an opinion as to whether or not the threat or use would be lawful in specific extreme circumstances such as if the survival of the state were at stake.', 'Perhaps the most controversial idea in nuclear strategy is that nuclear proliferation would be desirable.', 'This view argues that, unlike conventional weapons, nuclear weapons successfully deter all-out war between states, and they are said to have done this during the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union .', 'Political scientist Kenneth Waltz is the most prominent advocate of this argument .', 'The threat of potentially suicidal terrorists possessing nuclear weapons (a form of nuclear terrorism) complicates the decision process.', 'The prospect of mutually assured destruction may not deter an enemy who expects to die in the confrontation.', 'Further, if the initial act is from a stateless terrorist instead of a sovereign nation, there is no fixed nation or fixed military targets to retaliate against.', 'It has been argued, especially after the September 11, 2001 attacks, that this complication is the sign of the next age of nuclear strategy, distinct from the relative stability of the Cold War .', 'In 1996, the United States adopted a policy of allowing the targeting of its nuclear weapons at terrorists armed with weapons of mass destruction .', 'Because of the immense military power they can confer, the political control of nuclear weapons has been a key issue for as long as they have existed; in most countries the use of nuclear force can only be authorized by the head of government or head of state .', 'In the late 1940s, lack of mutual trust was preventing the United States and the Soviet Union from making ground towards international arms control agreements, but by the 1960s steps were being taken to limit both the proliferation of nuclear weapons to other countries and the environmental effects of nuclear testing.', 'The Partial Test Ban Treaty (1963) restricted all nuclear testing to underground nuclear testing, to prevent contamination from nuclear fallout, while the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (1968) attempted to place restrictions on the types of activities which signatories could participate in, with the goal of allowing the transference of non-military nuclear technology to member countries without fear of proliferation.', 'In 1957, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was established under the mandate of the United Nations in order to encourage the development of the peaceful applications of nuclear technology, provide international safeguards against its misuse, and facilitate the application of safety measures in its use.', 'In 1996, many nations signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty which prohibits all testing of nuclear weapons, which would impose a significant hindrance to their development by any complying country .', 'Due to the strict entry-into-force criterion of the convention however, it had as of 2011 not entered into force .', 'Additional treaties and agreements have governed nuclear weapons stockpiles between the countries with the two largest stockpiles, the United States and the Soviet Union, and later between the United States and Russia.', 'These include treaties such as SALT II (never ratified), START I (expired), INF, START II (never ratified), SORT, and New START, as well as non-binding agreements such as SALT I and the Presidential Nuclear Initiatives of 1991.', 'Even when they did not enter into force, these agreements helped limit and later reduce the numbers and types of nuclear weapons between the United States and the Soviet Union/Russia.', 'Nuclear weapons have also been opposed by agreements between countries.', 'Many nations have been declared Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones, areas where nuclear weapons production and deployment are prohibited, through the use of treaties.', 'The Treaty of Tlatelolco (1967) prohibited any production or deployment of nuclear weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Treaty of Pelindaba (1964) prohibits nuclear weapons in many African countries.', 'As recently as 2006 a Central Asian Nuclear Weapon Free Zone was established amongst the former Soviet republics of Central Asia prohibiting nuclear weapons.', 'In the middle of 1996, the International Court of Justice, the highest court of the United Nations, issued an Advisory Opinion concerned with the \"Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons\".', 'The court ruled that the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons would violate various articles of international law, including the Geneva Conventions, the Hague Conventions, the UN Charter, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.', 'In view of the unique, destructive characteristics of nuclear weapons, the International Committee of the Red Cross calls on States to ensure that these weapons are never used, irrespective of whether they consider them to be lawful or not .', 'Additionally, there have been other, specific actions meant to discourage countries from developing nuclear arms.', 'In the wake of the tests by India and Pakistan in 1998, economic sanctions were (temporarily) levied against both countries, though neither were signatories with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.', 'One of the stated casus belli for the initiation of the 2003 Iraq War was an accusation by the United States that Iraq was actively pursuing nuclear arms (though this was soon discovered not to be the case as the program had been discontinued).', \"In 1981, Israel had bombed a nuclear reactor being constructed in Osirak, Iraq, in what it called an attempt to halt Iraq's previous nuclear arms ambitions; in 2007, Israel bombed another reactor being constructed in Syria.\", 'Nuclear disarmament refers to both the act of reducing or eliminating nuclear weapons and to the end state of a nuclear-free world, in which nuclear weapons are completely eliminated.', 'Beginning with the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty and continuing through the 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, there have been many treaties to limit or reduce nuclear weapons testing and stockpiles.', 'The 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has as one of its explicit conditions that all signatories must \"pursue negotiations in good faith\" towards the long-term goal of \"complete disarmament\".', 'However, no nuclear state has treated that aspect of the agreement as having binding force .', 'Only one country—South Africa—has ever fully renounced nuclear weapons they had independently developed.', 'A number of former Soviet republics—Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine—returned Soviet nuclear arms stationed in their countries to Russia after the collapse of the USSR.', 'Proponents of nuclear disarmament say that it would lessen the probability of nuclear war occurring, especially accidentally.', 'Critics of nuclear disarmament say that it would undermine deterrence and could lead to increased global instability.', 'Various American government officials, who were in office during the Cold War period, have recently been advocating the elimination of nuclear weapons.', 'These officials include Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Sam Nunn, and William Perry.', 'In January 2010, Lawrence M. Krauss stated that \"no issue carries more importance to the long-term health and security of humanity than the effort to reduce, and perhaps one day, rid the world of nuclear weapons\" .', 'In the years after the end of the Cold War, there have been numerous campaigns to urge the abolition of nuclear weapons, such as that organized by the Global Zero movement, and the goal of a \"world without nuclear weapons\" was advocated by United States President Barack Obama in an April 2009 speech in Prague .', 'A CNN poll from April 2010 indicated that the American public was nearly evenly split on the issue .', 'Even before the first nuclear weapons had been developed, scientists involved with the Manhattan Project were divided over the use of the weapon.', \"The role of the two atomic bombings of the country in Japan's surrender and the U.S.'s ethical justification for them has been the subject of scholarly and popular debate for decades.\", 'The question of whether nations should have nuclear weapons, or test them, has been continually and nearly universally controversial.', 'Radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons testing was first drawn to public attention in 1954 when the Castle Bravo hydrogen bomb test at the Pacific Proving Grounds contaminated the crew and catch of the Japanese fishing boat Lucky Dragon .', 'One of the fishermen died in Japan seven months later, and the fear of contaminated tuna led to a temporary boycotting of the popular staple in Japan.', 'The incident caused widespread concern around the world, especially regarding the effects of nuclear fallout and atmospheric nuclear testing, and \"provided a decisive impetus for the emergence of the anti-nuclear weapons movement in many countries\" .', 'Peace movements emerged in Japan and in 1954 they converged to form a unified \"Japanese Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs\".', 'Japanese opposition to nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific Ocean was widespread, and \"an estimated 35 million signatures were collected on petitions calling for bans on nuclear weapons\" .', 'In the United Kingdom, the first Aldermaston March organised by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament took place at Easter 1958, when several thousand people marched for four days from Trafalgar Square, London, to the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment close to Aldermaston in Berkshire, England, to demonstrate their opposition to nuclear weapons .', 'The Aldermaston marches continued into the late 1960s when tens of thousands of people took part in the four-day marches .', 'In 1959, a letter in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists was the start of a successful campaign to stop the Atomic Energy Commission dumping radioactive waste in the sea 19 kilometres from Boston .', 'In 1962, Linus Pauling won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work to stop the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, and the \"Ban the Bomb\" movement spread .', 'In 1963, many countries ratified the Partial Test Ban Treaty prohibiting atmospheric nuclear testing.', 'Radioactive fallout became less of an issue and the anti-nuclear weapons movement went into decline for some years .', 'A resurgence of interest occurred amid European and American fears of nuclear war in the 1980s .', 'Between 1940 and 1996, the U.S. spent at least $ in present day terms on nuclear weapons development.', 'Over half was spent on building delivery mechanisms for the weapon.', '$ in present day terms was spent on nuclear waste management and environmental remediation .', 'Apart from their use as weapons, nuclear explosives have been tested and used for various non-military uses, and proposed, but not used for large-scale earth moving.', 'When long term health and clean-up costs were included, there was no economic advantage over conventional explosives .', 'Synthetic elements, such as einsteinium and fermium, created by neutron bombardment of uranium and plutonium during thermonuclear explosions, were discovered in the aftermath of the first thermonuclear bomb test.', 'In 2008 the worldwide presence of new isotopes from atmospheric testing beginning in the 1950s was developed into a reliable way of detecting art forgeries, as all paintings created after that period may contain traces of cesium-137 and strontium-90, isotopes that did not exist in nature before 1945 .', 'Nuclear explosives have also been seriously studied as potential propulsion mechanisms for space travel (see Project Orion) and for asteroid deflection.']),\n",
       "        list(['Deficit spending is the amount by which a government, private company, or individual\\'s spending exceeds income over a particular period of time, also called simply \"deficit\", or \"budget deficit\", the opposite of budget surplus.', 'Government deficit spending is a central point of controversy in economics, as discussed below.', 'Government deficit spending is a central point of controversy in economics, with prominent economists holding differing views .', 'The mainstream economics position is that deficit spending is desirable and necessary as part of countercyclical fiscal policy, but that there should not be a structural deficit: in an economic slump, government should run deficits, to compensate for the shortfall in aggregate demand, but should run corresponding surpluses in boom times so that there is no net deficit over an economic cycle – a cyclical deficit only.', 'This is derived from Keynesian economics, and has been the mainstream economics view (in the Anglo-Saxon world especially) since Keynesian economics was developed and largely accepted in the Great Depression in the 1930s.', 'The mainstream position is attacked from both sides – advocates of sound finance argue that deficit spending is always bad policy, while some Post-Keynesian economists, particularly Chartalists, argue that deficit spending is necessary, and not only for fiscal stimulus.', 'Advocates of sound finance (in the US known as fiscal conservatism) reject Keynesianism and, in the strongest form, argue that government should always run a balanced budget (and a surplus to pay down any outstanding debt), and that deficit spending is always bad policy.', 'Sound finance has academic support, predominantly associated with the neoclassical-inclined Chicago school of economics, and has significant political and institutional support, with all but one state of the United States (Vermont is the exception) having a balanced budget amendment to its state constitution, and the Stability and Growth Pact of the European Monetary Union punishing government deficits of 3% of GDP or greater.', 'Proponents of sound finance date back to Adam Smith, founder of modern economics.', 'Sound finance was the dominant position until the Great Depression, associated with the gold standard and expressed in the Treasury View that government fiscal policy was ineffective.', 'The usual argument against deficit spending, dating to Adam Smith, is that households should not run deficits – one should have money before one spends it, from prudence – and that what is correct for a household is correct for a nation and its government.', 'A further argument is that debts must be repaid, and thus it is burdening future generations to run deficits today, for little or no gain.', 'A similar argument is that deficit spending today will require increased taxation in the future, thus burdening future generations – see generational accounting for discussion.', 'Others argue that because debt is both owed by and owed to private individuals, there is no net debt burden of government debt, just wealth transfer (redistribution) from those who owe debt (government, backed by tax payers) to those who hold debt (holders of government bonds) .', 'A related line of argument, associated with the Austrian school of economics, is that government deficits are inflationary.', 'Anything other than mild or moderate inflation is generally accepted in economics to be a bad thing.', 'In practice this is argued to be because governments pay off debts by printing fiat money, increasing the money supply and creating inflation, and is taken further by some as an argument against fiat money and in favor of hard money, especially the gold standard.', 'Conversely, some Post-Keynesian economists argue that deficit spending is necessary, either to create the money supply (Chartalism) or to satisfy demand for savings in excess of what can be satisfied by private investment.', 'Chartalists argue that deficit spending is logically necessary because, in their view, fiat money is created by deficit spending: one cannot collect fiat money in taxes before one has issued it and spent it, and the amount of fiat money in circulation is exactly the government debt – money spent but not collected in taxes.', 'In a quip, \"fiat money governments are \\'spend and tax\\', not \\'tax and spend\\',\" – deficit spending comes first.', 'Chartalists argue that nations are fundamentally different from households – governments in a fiat money system can issue liabilities to pay off debt, and thus (assuming they only have debt in their own currency), need not go bankrupt, unlike households, which cannot issue liabilities.', 'This view is summarized as:\\n\\nBut it is hard to understand how the concept of \"budget busting\" applies to a government which, as a sovereign issuer of its own currency, can always create dollars to spend.', 'There is, in other words, no budget to \"bust\".', 'A national \"budget\" is merely an account of national spending priorities, and does not represent an external constraint in the manner of a household budget .', 'Continuing in this vein, Chartalists argue that a structural deficit is necessary for monetary expansion in an expanding economy: if the economy grows, the money supply should as well, which should be accomplished by government deficit spending.', 'Private sector savings are equal to government sector deficits, to the penny.', 'In the absence of sufficient deficit spending, money supply can increase by increasing financial leverage in the economy – the amount of bank money grows, while the base money supply remains unchanged or grows at a slower rate, and thus the ratio (leverage = credit/base) increases, which can lead to a credit bubble and a financial crisis.', 'Chartalism is a small minority view in economics; while it has had advocates over the years, and influenced Keynes, who specifically credited it, it is categorically rejected or ignored by virtually all contemporary mainstream economists.', 'A notable proponent was Ukrainian American economist Abba P. Lerner, who founded the school of Neo-Chartalism, and advocated deficit spending in his theory of functional finance.', 'A contemporary center of Neo-Chartalism is the Kansas City School of economics.', 'Chartalists, like other Keynesians accept the paradox of thrift, which argues that identifying behavior of individual households and the nation as a whole commits the fallacy of composition; while the paradox of thrift (and thus deficit spending for fiscal stimulus) is widely accepted in economics, the Chartalist form is not.', 'An alternative argument for the necessity of deficits was given by celebrated American economist William Vickrey, who argued that deficits were necessary to satisfy demand for savings in excess of what can be satisfied by private investment.', 'Larger deficits, sufficient to recycle savings out of a growing gross domestic product (GDP) in excess of what can be recycled by profit-seeking private investment, are not an economic sin but an economic necessity. .', 'When the outlay of a government (its purchases of goods and services, plus its transfers (grants) to individuals and corporations, in addition to its net interest payments) exceed its tax revenues, the government budget is said to be in deficit; government spending in excess of tax receipts is known as deficit spending.', 'Governments usually issue Government bonds to match their deficits.', 'They can be bought by its Central Bank through Quantitative easing.', 'Otherwise the debt issuance can increase the level of (i) public debt, (ii) private sector net worth, (iii) debt service (interest payments) and (iv) interest rates (See: \"crowding out\" below).', 'Deficit spending may, however, be consistent with public debt remaining stable as a proportion of GDP, depending on the level of GDP growth.', 'The opposite of a budget deficit is a budget surplus; in this case, tax revenues exceed government purchases and transfer payments.', 'For the public sector to be in deficit implies that the private sector (domestic and foreign) is in surplus.', 'An increase in public indebtedness must necessarily therefore correspond to an equal decrease in private sector net indebtedness.', 'In other words, deficit spending permits the private sector to accumulate net worth.', 'On average, through the economic cycle, most governments have traditionally tended to run budget deficits, as can be seen from the large debt balances accumulated by governments across the world.', 'Following John Maynard Keynes, many economists recommend deficit spending to moderate or end a recession, especially a severe one.', 'When the economy has high unemployment, an increase in government purchases creates a market for business output, creating income and encouraging increases in consumer spending, which creates further increases in the demand for business output. (', 'This is the multiplier effect).', 'This raises the real gross domestic product (GDP) and the employment of labour, and if all else is constant, lowers the unemployment rate. (', \"The connection between demand for GDP and unemployment is called Okun's Law.)\", 'Cutting personal taxes and/or raising transfer payments can have similar expansionary effects, though which method has a better stimulative economic effect is a matter of debate.', 'The increased size of the market, due to government deficits, can further stimulate the economy by raising business profitability and spurring optimism, which encourages private fixed investment in factories, machines, and the like to rise.', 'This accelerator effect stimulates demand further and encourages rising employment.', 'Increase in government payroll has been shown to depress the economy in the long run.', 'Similarly, running a government surplus or reducing its deficit reduces consumer and business spending and raises unemployment.', 'This can lower the inflation rate.', 'Any use of the government deficit to steer the macro-economy is called fiscal policy.', 'A deficit does not simply stimulate demand.', 'If private investment is stimulated, that increases the ability of the economy to supply output in the long run.', \"Also, if the government's deficit is spent on such things as infrastructure, basic research, public health, and education, that can also increase potential output in the long run.\", \"Finally, the high demand that a government deficit provides may actually allow greater growth of potential supply, following Verdoorn's Law.\", 'There is, however, a danger that deficit spending may create inflation - or encourage existing inflation to persist. (', 'In the United States, this is seen most clearly when Vietnam-war era deficits encouraged inflation.)', 'This is especially true at low unemployment rates (say, below 4% unemployment in the U.S.).', 'But government deficits are not the only cause of inflation: it can arise due to such supply-side shocks as the \"oil crises\" of the 1970s and inflation left over from the past (inflationary expectations and the price/wage spiral).', 'If equilibrium is located on the classical range of the supply graph, an increase in government spending will lead to inflation without affecting unemployment.', 'There must also be enough money circulating in the system to allow inflation to persist—so that inflation depends on monetary policy.', 'Many economists believe government deficits influence the economy through the loanable funds market, whose existence Chartalists and other Post-Keynesians dispute.', 'Government borrowing in this market increases the demand for loanable funds and thus (ignoring other changes) pushes up interest rates.', 'Rising interest rates can \"crowd out\" (discourage) fixed private investment spending, canceling out some or even all of the demand stimulus arising from the deficit—and perhaps hurting long-term supply-side growth.', 'But increased deficits also raise the amount of total income received, which raises the amount of saving done by individuals and corporations and thus the supply of loanable funds, lowering interest rates.', 'Thus, crowding out is a problem only when the economy is already close to full employment (say, at about 4% unemployment) and the scope for increasing income and saving is blocked by resource constraints (potential output).', 'Despite a government debt that exceeded GDP in 1945, the U.S. saw the long prosperity of the 1950s and 1960s.', 'The growth of the \"supply side\", it seems, was not hurt by the large deficits and debts.', 'A government deficit leads to increased government debt (often confusingly called the \"national debt\" or the \"public debt\").', 'In the U.S., the government borrows by selling bonds (T-bills, etc.)', 'rather than getting loans from banks.', \"The most important burden of this debt is the interest that must be paid to bond-holders, which restricts a government's ability to raise its outlays or cut taxes to attain other goals.\", 'Usually when economists use the term \"crowding out\" they are referring to the government spending using up financial and other resources that would otherwise be used by private enterprise.', 'However, some commentators use \"crowding out\" to refer to government providing a service or good that would otherwise be a business opportunity for private industry.', 'Whether government deficits are good or bad cannot be decided without examining the specifics.', 'Just as with borrowing by individuals or businesses, it can be good or bad.', 'If the government borrows (runs a deficit) to deal with a severe recession (or depression), to help self-defense, or spends on public investment (in infrastructure, education, basic research, or public health), the vast majority of economists would agree that the deficit is bearable, beneficial, and even necessary.', 'If, on the other hand, the deficit finances wasteful expenditure or current consumption, most would recommend tax cuts to stimulate private investment, transfer cuts, and/or cuts in government purchases to balance the budget.', 'Not all national government deficits are intentional, a result of policy decisions.', 'When an economy goes into a recession (say, due to monetary policy), deficits usually rise, at least in the U.S. and other large, rich, countries: with less economic activity, a relatively progressive tax system based on economic activity (income, expenditure, or transactions) implies that tax revenues automatically fall.', 'Similarly, transfer payments such as unemployment insurance benefits and food stamp grants rise.', 'By contrast, other sources of tax revenue such as wealth taxes, notably property taxes, are not subject to recessions, though they are subject to asset price bubbles.', 'The reliance of California on state income tax, rather than property tax, due to property taxes being limited by Proposition 13, has been cited as an example of the dangers of an income tax-reliant tax system and a cause of the 2008–10 California budget crisis.', 'Most economists favor the use of automatic stabilization over active or discretionary use of deficits to fight mild recessions (or surpluses to combat inflation).', 'Active policy-making takes too long for politicians to institute and too long to affect the economy.', 'Often, the medicine ends up affecting the economy only after its disease has been cured, leaving the economy with side-effects such as inflation.', 'For example, President John F. Kennedy proposed tax cuts in response to the high unemployment of 1960, but these were instituted only in 1964 and impacted the economy only in 1965 or 1966 and the increased debt encouraged inflation, reinforcing the effect of Vietnam war deficit spending.', 'Deficit financing is the practice of a network or channel paying the studio that creates a show a license fee in exchange for the right to air the show.', 'A major broadcast network will ask a program producer to share in the financial risk when considering adopting a new program to its schedule; at least for the first season of the series.', 'The deficit is essentially the network not paying the full total of the cost to create a pilot program or of the cost of creating episodes of a new program.', 'Deficit financing also helps to minimize the substantial risks and costs of developing programs for the networks and gives studios initial benefits as well.', 'The studio bears the difference between production costs and licensing fees, but recoups significantly more money if the show is sold in syndication.', 'If the network orders enough episodes of a show, the studio can then sell the series to other markets.', 'Deficit financing minimizes risks and costs of developing programs for networks .'])],\n",
